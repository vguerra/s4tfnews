## News and Articles

* On Friday 17th of January, the 21st SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Dan Zheng](https://twitter.com/dancherp) and [Marc Rasi](http://www.marcrasi.com/) held an interactive discussion on common `AutoDiff` issues in the current implementation which sparked very interesting discussions. Have a look at the [slides (up to slide #9)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#) for issues discussed.


    You can find the [meeting recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JyYvYBMpFIvBU9jgvNU4XdLuK1_i5rvR/view?usp=sharing), notes  and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).

* A new Xcode 11 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2020-01-14-a-osx.pkg).
