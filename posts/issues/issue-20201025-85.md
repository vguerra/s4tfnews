## News and Articles

* On Friday 23rd of October, the 42nd SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Marc Rasi](http://www.marcrasi.com/) gave a talk showcasing [SwiftFusion](https://github.com/borglab/SwiftFusion): A Differentiable Swift-based sensor fusion library. Marc explained factor graphs and exposed some implementation details within the library. The slides of the presentation are available [online](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_CvEiY6RSdRQXXE5_a652uIl3tgKy2248zTm_URU_KU/edit#slide=id.p).

    * [Fan Jiang](https://twitter.com/FanOnRobotics) presented a use case for SwiftFusion: Bee Tracking, explaining how factor graphs can be used for tracking. The slides of the presentation are available [online](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_ld369jPlN6l9-n6XaD1fwOXClSEsAWKNZxTEu6AiPs/edit#slide=id.p).

    You can find the notes for this meeting in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).

    Recording from this session will be available soon.


## The mailing list

* [Michelle Casbon](https://twitter.com/texasmichelle) announced the release of experimental Deep Learning VM images with S4TF toolchains and CUDA libraries pre-installed on Ubuntu 18.04. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/g/swift/c/JtWuW3TFWDo/m/sCWHfF7hBgAJ))
