## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (main branch)

* [PR-35133](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/35133): Enables `@differentiable` attribute on setters of properties and subscripts in `Differentiable`-conforming types. Resolves [TF-1166](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-1166).

* [PR-35079](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/35079): Replaces `SILAutoDiffIndices` with `AutoDiffConfig`. Resolves [SR-13889](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13889).

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-1150](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/1150): Builds `CTensorFlow` with `SPM` as it provides the `C` bindings for `X10` and is required for building with `X10` and `SPM`.

* [PR-1155](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/1155): Extracts developer documentation.

* [PR-1151](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/1151): Adds a hard dependency on `PythonKit` with `SPM`.

* [PR-1148](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/1148): Adjusts a few cases of type conversion in `TensorFlowTests`.

* [PR-1147](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/1147): Requires `swift-numerics` when building with `SPM`.

* [PR-1146](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/1146): Adds `shim.c` file for `CTensorFlow` that serves appease Swift Package Manager which requires that any non-Swift library must have a source file.

#### Swift Jupyter

* [PR-128](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter/pull/128): Makes the tests work on the stock toolchain.

#### Swift Models

* [PR-723](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/723): Adds `presubmit_build.sh` that passes a flag to `swiftpm` if it is a stock toolchain.

* [PR-722](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/722): Initiates compatibility with stock toolchain.

* [PR-718](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/718): Adds "top 5 accuracy" metric.

* [PR-707](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/707): Adds `Xception` network.

* [PR-688](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/688): Adds imagenet dataset + training demo.
