## News and Articles

* On Friday 7th of August, the 37th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Brett Koonce](https://twitter.com/asparagui) presented his soon to be released book: [Convolutional Neural Networks with Swift for Tensorflow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1484261674/). The recording for this session will soon be available.

* New Development snapshots are available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow: [Xcode 11](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow-artifacts/macos-toolchains/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2020-08-05-a-osx.pkg).
