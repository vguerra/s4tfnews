## News and Articles

* On July 2nd, The [TWIML Podcast](https://twimlai.com/) organized a live discussion to talk about [languages for Machine Learning](https://twimlai.com/the-great-ml-language-un-debate/). Among the panelists there was [Chris Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm) representing Swift. Other languages represented in the discussion were: Clojure, JavaScript, Julia, Python, R, and Scala. Checkout the recording which is available [here](https://twimlai.com/the-great-ml-language-un-debate/).

* A new Xcode 11 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow-artifacts/macos-toolchains/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2020-07-02-a-osx.pkg).
