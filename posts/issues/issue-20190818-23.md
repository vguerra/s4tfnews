## News and Articles

* On Friday 16th of August, the 7th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Bart Chrzaszcz](https://twitter.com/bart_chr) made a deep dive into the details of the [Forward Mode Compiler Transform](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_kF5_VgsNAiDIrMIc1uMxjuXIFiZleNBOThnTQ_eMJ8/edit#slide=id.gc6f73a04f_0_0).

    * [Brennan Saeta](https://twitter.com/bsaeta) went over the list of items the S4TF core team is focusing in the short-term:
        * Automatic differentation.
        * Metaprogramming with quasiquotes and MLIR.
        * C++ interoperability.
        * TPU Support.
        * Developper tooling.

    You can find the meeting notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).

* [Choong Ng](https://twitter.com/choongng) has put together a [nice guide](https://gist.github.com/choongng/8999ac7fed85fb22b7b2204e36ead727) for you to get started with Swift for TensorFlow with Docker on macOS. It guides you through the necessary steps to have the latest release of S4TF ( v.0.4.0) working on Jupyter notebooks, making it easy for you to start exploring [fast.ai S4TF Notebooks](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3.git).

* As part of his [fast.ai journey](https://rickwierenga.com/tag/fastai), [Rick Wierenga](https://twitter.com/rickwierenga), has written two lesson  summaries:
    * [Lesson 13 - Linear Regression in Swift for Tensorflow](https://rickwierenga.com/blog/fast.ai/FastAI2019-13.html) which show cases how to get started with Swift for TensorFlow.
    * [Lesson 14 - An end at the beginning](https://rickwierenga.com/blog/fast.ai/FastAI2019-14.html) that explains how Rick re-wrote the project of the very [1st Lesson](https://rickwierenga.com/blog/fast.ai/FastAI2019-1.html), A fruit classifier, using Swift for TensoFlow. He even created a Swift package to access Kaggle API: [SwiftKaggle](https://github.com/rickwierenga/SwiftKaggle).

* [Karthik Ramesh Iyer](https://twitter.com/karthik_r_iyer) shared the [progress of his GSoC 2019](https://cgknowhow.tumblr.com/post/187095661549/gsoc-coding-phase-part-4), [a Data Visualization Library for Swift](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4558376158101504), talking about how he leveraged the power of Swift Generics and C interoperatiblity in his library.

* [Paige Bailey](https://twitter.com/dynamicwebpaige) has shared on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/1161871568953212928) a link to the [Swift Development Environment VSCode Extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.vscode-swift-development-environment). If you like to code in Visual Studio defenitely check it out. ([Github repo](https://github.com/vknabel/vscode-swift-development-environment)).
