## News and Articles

* [Jacopo Mangiavacchi](https://twitter.com/jacopomangia) shared a post showing how you can [train a LeNet CNN MNIST model directly on iPhone](https://medium.com/@JMangia/mnist-cnn-core-ml-training-c0f081014fa6). You can find the source code of the blog post on [GitHub](https://github.com/JacopoMangiavacchi/MNIST-CoreML-Training).

* [Devesh Shetty](https://twitter.com/thedeveshshetty) gave a talk at [TensorFlow UserGroup Mumbai](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMlfIpRC-995awLMUzdHSIg) introduction to Swift for TensorFlow. The recording is already available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdsiVplwbYU).

* [tryolabs](https://tryolabs.com/) is organizing a webinar called [A deeper dive into Swift for Tensorflow](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_SnhWLtKOQ8-BxEhyoFzfuw) on which they will expand their blog post [Swift: Google's bet on differentiable programming](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2020/04/02/swift-googles-bet-on-differentiable-programming/). The webinar is scheduled for May 7th, 2020 at  05:00 PM (UTC). Be sure to register [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_SnhWLtKOQ8-BxEhyoFzfuw?timezone_id=UTC).

* On Friday 24th of April, the 29th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

	* [Michelle Casbon](https://github.com/texasmichelle) made a presentation on a proposal to have summaries for models. Her slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hEhMiwLtuzsN3RvIC3FAh6NvtTimU8o_qdzMkGvntVg).

	Recording from this session is available [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ju0Pb0bJ5Vs5ti6tkVAZJHs2NDsWDFN4/view?usp=sharing).
	
	As well, you can find the notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).


* Nightly Toolchains with support for CUDA 10.2 are now available. You can find them in the [Development Snapshots](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#development-snapshots).


## The mailing list

* Peter Jung asks how one can do automatic model search? ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/IP5D-1DT-Mc/bSEytd2MBQAJ))

* James MacGlashan asked how does `Array` conform to `Differentiable`?. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/H6HvVwQOQMU/AjwlR9ppBQAJ)).

* Rahul asked about use case of differentiable initializer. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/Z3fsqmjJQ-o/d0vNR4DtBAAJ)).

* rex-remind started a conversation on Adding multithreading to PythonKit. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/MWFwGhHT36w/h57om4aDBAAJ))
