## News and Articles

* The 2nd release candidate for Swift for TensorFlow 0.9.0 is now available. Grab a copy from the [Release Candidate](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#release-candidates)'s section from the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md). The [S4TF v0.9 Release Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sk3F_owEF0wAo26xO1RTbdSbQV9eb5tMKQX3EgLeD1o/edit#) document guides you through all changes since v0.8, new changes and known issues. Please give this release a try and report any issues you find on [JIRA](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF) or GitHub issues on [Swift-APIs](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues).

* On Friday 8th of May, the 31st SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

	* [Sylvain Gugger](https://twitter.com/guggersylvain) introduced `Epocs`, which allows you to create input pipelines for training models and inference and will be a replacement for the current `Dataset` in `swift-apis` and `Batcher` in `swift-models`. His slides are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-mYjnsW1qVYhzvc68jsrrijnqS7w1DMs/view).

	* [Jacopo Mangiavacchi](https://twitter.com/jacopomangia) gave an overview of one of his [recent medium posts](https://medium.com/@JMangia/mnist-cnn-core-ml-training-c0f081014fa6) talking about training a LeNet-MNIST model from scratch on iOS.

	Recording from this session is available [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iNy-NOvGeLCsSAPx8rYRjLsXMbcdBsqC/view?usp=sharing).

	You can find the notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).


* This past 7th of May, the [webinar](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_SnhWLtKOQ8-BxEhyoFzfuw) organized by [Tryolabs](https://tryolabs.com/) on the topic **A deeper dive into Swift for Tensorflow** took place. If you were not able to attend then have a look at the recording on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFPrypPBpU).
