## News and Articles

* The final release of Swift for Tensorflow v0.4 is now available ðŸŽ‰. Grab one of the pre-built toolchains available [in the Install instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#releases) or give it a try in [Colaboratory](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Usage.md#colaboratory). As usual, freel free to report any issues in the mailing list [swift@tensorflow.org](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/swift), the [JIRA-bug tracker](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF) or [GitHub Issue tracker for Swift-APIs](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues).

* On Friday 9th of August, the 6th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Eugene Burmako](https://twitter.com/eugene_burmako) presented the initial work on [Swift as Syntactic sugar for MLIR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIPWl4lvBTozBD5OQ9SrxgcM7rA4pODMOjqQv3tm57w/edit) which aims at explore ways to metaprogram MLIR in Swift. Check out as well his [post](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-as-syntactic-sugar-for-mlir/27672) on the Swift forums.

    * [Anthony Platanios](https://twitter.com/eaplatanios) gave an overview on his proposal [PR-431](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/431) which adds sipport for learning rate schedules.

    * If you missed the previous meeting, you can catch up watching the [recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DBUR9o0v7ccvJ9eefTampJfljlaW2XZW/view), specially if you are interested in the AD implementation overview.
    
    You can find the meeting notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).

* [Bart Chrzaszcz](https://twitter.com/bart_chr) has put together a nice tutorial on Protocol Oriented Programming and Generics in Swift. You can find it in the [Tutorials](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift#tutorials-) of the project's README.

* [Paige Bailey](https://twitter.com/dynamicwebpaige) and [Daniel Situnayake](https://twitter.com/dansitu) made a video responding many questions from users around the world about TF Life and Swift for Tensorflow. Check it out on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oT3pzOtZKv0).


## The mailing list

* [Anthony Platanios](https://twitter.com/eaplatanios) has started a thread to discuss with the community design issues around `KeyPathIterable`-based optimizers as there present currently some issues. This is related to his presentation during last SIG meeting (see previous section) and his [PR-431](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/431).

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-26595](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26595): Adds mangling support for `@differentiable` function tyopes. Allows as well to build macOS toolchains with `--release-debuginfo` flag.  Resolves [PR-TF-597](https://bugs.swift.org/projects/TF/issues/TF-597).

* [PR-26553](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26553): Fixes wrong ordering on pullback results. Resolves [TF-742](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-742).

* [PR-26518](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26518): Introduces experimental prototype of [Swift quasiquotes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIPWl4lvBTozBD5OQ9SrxgcM7rA4pODMOjqQv3tm57w/edit).

* [PR-26527](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26527): Deprecates `AllDifferentiableVariables` associated type of `Differentiable` protocol. Related PR: [PR-419](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/419). Resolves ([TF-707](https://bugs.swift.org/projects/TF/issues/TF-707)). 

* [PR-26484](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26484): Fixes memory leak when noescape closure being differentiated captures a mutable self.

* [PR-26503](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26503): Enables ownership for AD linear map `SILGen` thunks.

* [PR-26448](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26448): Fixes self re-ordering bug of `SILGen` JVP/VJP thunks . Resolves [TF-698](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-698).

* [PR-26447](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26447): Removes deprecated tests in `TensorFlowUnittest` and AD control flow tests as they have been moved to the `[swift-api](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis)`'s repo ([PR-408](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues/408)) . 

* [c9672311](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/c96723117155192dbec76e3004e0dfd4241d4a81): Improves reabstraction of a `@differentiable` function during `SIL` generation by avoiding copies of the original `@differentiable` function.
