## News and Articles

* The 1st release candidate for Swift for TensorFlow 0.9.0 is now available. Grab a copy from the [Release Candidate](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#release-candidates)'s section from the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md). The [S4TF v0.9 Release Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sk3F_owEF0wAo26xO1RTbdSbQV9eb5tMKQX3EgLeD1o/edit#) document guides you through all changes since v0.8, new changes and known issues. Please give this release a try and report any issues you find on [JIRA](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF) or GitHub issues on [Swift-APIs](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues).


* On Friday 1st of May, the 30th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

	* [Anthony Platanios](https://twitter.com/eaplatanios) presented his work on [Jelly Bean World ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06306) a framework for never ending learning using Swift for TensorFlow.

	You can find the notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).


* [Wojciech Czarnowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wojtekcz/) shared his project [Language2motion](https://github.com/wojtekcz/language2motion), which has as goal to create multi-modal implementation of Transformer architecture in Swift. Check out the announcement [here](https://forums.fast.ai/t/language2motion-project-in-swift/69599?u=vguerra).
