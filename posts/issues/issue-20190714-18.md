## News and Articles

* Release candidate #2 of Swift for Tensorflow v0.4 is now available. Grab the toolchain from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#releases) or give it a try in [Google Colab](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift#tutorials-).

* This past Wednesday, July 10th 2019, the first meeting of the [Swift for Tensorflow Tokyo meetup](https://connpass.com/event/138112/) took place:
    *  [omochimetaru](https://twitter.com/omochimetaru) gave an [introductory talk about S4TF](https://speakerdeck.com/omochi/swift-for-tensorflow-is-a-completely-new-paradigm-for-machine-learning).
    * [Eugene Burmako](https://twitter.com/eugene_burmako), from the Google AI team, was there to give an overview of Tensorflow.
    *  [Masaki Kozuki](https://twitter.com/crcrpar) talked about MLIR and even wrote a [summary of this 1st meetup](https://medium.com/@crcrpar/swift-for-tensorflow-meetup-in-tokyo-66a27904d9d1).

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26133): Fixes compiler bug due to `VJPEmitter`'s `SubstitutionMap` not using the VJP's generic signature.

* [PR-26113](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26113): Prevents to specify `jvp:` or `vjp` for `@differentiable` attribute on protocl requirement.

* [PR-25974](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25974): Allows conditional differentiability on `Protocol` requirements.

* [PR-26023](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26023): Introduces `@differentiable` versions of `Array.map` and `Array.reduce` called `Arrray.differentiableMap` and `differentiableReduce` respectively.

* [PR-25954](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25954): Introduces a `JVPEmitter`.

* [PR-25967](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25967): Fixes memory leaks during differentiation.

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-360](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/360): Adds `@differentiable` attribute for overloads of `min(_:_:)` and `max(_:_:)`.

* Introduction of new the following operations for `Tensors`:
    * [PR-358](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/358): Adds `cumulativeProduct(alongAxis:exclusive:reverse:)`. 
    * [PR-353](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/353): Adds `cumulativeSum(alongAxis:exclusive:reverse:)`.

* [PR-354](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/354), [PR-355](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/355): Introuces support for `Tensor` moments. As consequence a custom VJP for batch normalization is not needed.

* [PR-350](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/350): Fixes bug on computation of `rsqrt`'s gradient (`_vjpRsqrt`).

* [PR-347](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/347): Makes `Array` and `Array.DifferentiableView` conform to aggregate math protocols and collection protocols when appropiate. 

* [PR-341](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/341): Fixes bug on computation of `sigmoid`'s gradient (`_vjpSigmoid`). 

* [PR-340](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/340): Introduces `typealias` `TensorflowSeed` to standarize usage of seeds.

* [PR-339](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/339): Adds `sha1` hashing algorithm as an extention of `Array<Int8>`.

* [PR-336](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/336): Preconditions initializer `init(arrayLiteral:)` to reject initializations with no elements. This applies to `ShapedArraySlice`, `ShapedArray` and `Tensor`.

* [PR-334](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/334): Bug fix on initialization of `TransposedConv2D` Layer.


## Contributing

Looking to contribute to the project? Have a look at the currently open tickets for starters:

#### Swift TensorFlow API

* [Issue-160](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues/160): Update doc comments on non-mutating API to use proper wording.

* [Issue-127](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues/127): Adding more Optimizers and Losses.

* [Issue-77](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues/77):  Adding Test Cases for Layers in `Layer.swift` file.

* [Issue-54](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues/54): Implement more layers that are available in Keras.
