## News and Articles

* [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) has written [SwiftBPE](https://github.com/jph00/SwiftyBPE) which is a Swift wrapper for the C++ implementation of [Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909) ( called [fastBPE](https://github.com/glample/fastBPE).

## The mailing list

* [Slawek Smyl](https://twitter.com/slaweksmyl) started a discussion asking whether Swift for Tensorflow would allow multithreaded learning. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/OzZu4zq6wtk/2FnBcxaSEgAJ)).

* [Cristian Garcia](https://github.com/cgarciae) has created a data processing library written in Swift, called [Stream](https://github.com/cgarciae/Stream), that you can use during pre-processing of your data. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/LF8p76VprsE/EEtEnjP3AwAJ)).


## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-26209](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26242): Refactors memory managenment during differentiation, having the nice side effect of eliminating memory leaks that have been reported through various channles. Resolves [TF-621](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-621). 

* [PR-26242](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26242): Fixes memory leak on closure capturing. Resolves [TF-550](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-550).

* [PR-26232](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26232): Exposes forward mode Automatic Differentiation functions.

* [PR-26226](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26226): Improves leak-checking logic within `testWithLeakChecking`.

* [PR-26211](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26211): Cleans up zeros emitted when differentiating a `store`.

* [PR-26202](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26202): Fixes bug during parsing of SIL `[differentiable]` attributes. Resolving [TF-656](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-656).

* [PR-26179](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26179): Improves `@differentiable` attribute diagnostic messages and attribute printing.

* [PR-26173](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26173), [PR-26183](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26183): Rename adjoint function to pullback in the code base.

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-378](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/378): Marks all parameters of VJP's initializers as `__owned` as workaround for [TF-667](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-667).

* [PR-375](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/375): Replaces usage of `TFE_OpAddInputList` by multiple calls to `TFE_OpAddInput` due to bogus implementation of the former.

* [PR-372](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/372): Introduces `LazyTensorOperationsTracker` which tracks instances of `LazyTensorOperation`.

* [PR-370](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/370): Extracts `DeviceScopes` out into it's own structure.

* [PR-366](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/366), [PR-368](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/368), [PR-69](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/369): Make  `pow(_:_:)`, `root(_:_:)` and all `Tensor` functions conforming to `ElemntaryFunctions` `@differentiable`.

* [PR-348](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/348): Introduces `Tensor.isAlmostEqual(to:tolerance:)` and renames `Tensor.elementsApproximatelyEqual(_:tolerance:)` to `Tensor.elementsAlmostEqual(_:tolerance:)`.

* [PR-361](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/361): Introduces `Tensor.clipped(min:max:)`.
