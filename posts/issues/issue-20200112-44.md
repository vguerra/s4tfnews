## News and Articles

* [Jacopo Mangiavacchi](https://twitter.com/JacopoMangia) wrote an article called: [Swift loves TensorFlow and CoreML](https://medium.com/@JMangia/swift-loves-tensorflow-and-coreml-2a11da25d44). He explains how to export from `S4TF` to `CoreML` and enable on device model personalization / re-training. All done in Swift, no Python code involved.

* The [SIG Swift Design Meeting Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4) has been updated with links to all missing recordings from previous sessions.

* On Friday 10th of January, the 20th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Brennan Saeta](https://twitter.com/bsaeta)talked about [`Penguin`](https://github.com/saeta/penguin) which is a [toolkit of abstractions](https://saeta.github.io/penguin/) for parallel programming. You can find the slides of the presentation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mt8VRYvneo7zpVj70fgNGJ8br4-f2LmZ/view).


    You can find the meeting recording, notes  and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).
