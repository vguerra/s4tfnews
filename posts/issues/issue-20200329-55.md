## News and Articles

* On Friday 27th of March, the 27th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

	* [Brad Larson](https://twitter.com/bradlarson) talked about [S4TF Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models).
	* [Saleem Abdulrasool](https://twitter.com/compnerd) gave an overview of the different build systems used within the Swift for TensorFlow ecosystem. You can find his [slides online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1spFVsk6j3J4Aqt6oBW065wCCk9GRiPfl/view?usp=sharing).


	Recording from this session is available [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17rtt1MmeCItU-gbSr_79zE7eo7Wc8497/view?usp=sharing).
	
	As well, you can find the notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).

* A new Xcode 11 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2020-03-25-a-osx.pkg).
