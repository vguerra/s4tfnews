## News and Articles

* This week, [James Bradbury](https://twitter.com/jekbradbury) and [Richard Wei](https://twitter.com/rxwei) talked about Swift for Tensorflow during Google I/O'19 and the [recording is online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fJsqGHhlVA). You can as well access the [notebooks](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/tree/io19/demos) they demoed.

* The GSoC'19 Student-projects for the [Tensorflow organization](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6137730124218368/) have been announced and here we have the selected project ideas for Swift for Tensorflow: 

    * Ayush Agrawal will be working on [End-to-End Mobile Swift for Tensorflow Application](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4520326505955328). 

    * Karthik Ramesh Iyer will be working on [Data Visualization library for Swift](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4558376158101504).

    * Victor Antony will be working on [Adding traditional Machine Learning algorithms to Swift for Tensorflow](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5012389299224576).

    * Param Bhavsar will be working on [Add traditional machine learning algorithms to the Swift TensorFlow library](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5754013750919168).

    **Congratulations** to all four of them! üéä.


## The mailing list

* [Dan Zheng](https://twitter.com/dancherp) posted the official announcement of Swift for TensorFlow v0.3.1. Congratulations to the team and everyone who contributed to make this happen! üëèüèº . ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/S6KyX1szLuY/akpqY7yDAgAJ)).

* [Brennan Saeta](https://twitter.com/bsaeta) explains the reason of recent commits removing GPE from the Swift compiler (tensorflow branch). ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/3bixC_ujQcg/_SSW4Mi4AgAJ)).

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

*  Removal of dead/legacy code:

    * [PR-24723](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24723): Utility functions for GPE send/receive testing.
    * [PR-24720](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24720): `#tfop` code.
    * [PR-24719](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24719): GPE related code.
    * [PR-24714](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24714): AutoDiff Tape.

* [PR-24668](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24668): Fixes compiler crash when making a synthetized member conform to a protocol with property requirements.

* [PR-24639](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24639): Improves diagnostics for non-differentiability by making sure that error and note are produced as well as avoiding duplicates.

* [PR-24568](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24568): Brings back `TensorFlowRuntime` tests.

* [PR-24567](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24567): Adds attempt to inline (using `@inlinable`) `var allKeyPaths` only when all stored properties are public.

* [PR-24543](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24543): Improves printing of differentiation parameters clause for attributes `@differentiable` and `@differentiating` when printing AST and diagnostics.

* [PR-24538](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24538): Disallows derived conformances in extentions across files for the following protocols: `AdditiveArithmetic`, `VectorNumeric`, `KeyPathIterable`, `Differentiable`, `TensorArrayProtocol`, `TensorGroup`.


## Starter bugs

Looking to contribute to the project? Have a look at the currently open tickets for starters: 

* [TF-416](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-416): Produce error upon second usage of `PythonLibrary.useVersion`.
* [TF-67](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-67):  BumpPtrAllocating some classes that have SmallBitVector fields.
