## News and Articles

* [Max Pechyonkin](https://twitter.com/max_pechyonkin) wrote about Swift for Tensorflow, specially about the strenghts of Swift as a language for Machine Learning. Find the post in [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-swift-may-be-the-next-big-thing-in-deep-learning-f3f6a638ca72).

* An Xcode 10 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow-artifacts/releases/v0.3.1/rc1/swift-tensorflow-RELEASE-0.3.1-osx.pkg).


## The mailing list

* [Alexy Khrabrov](https://twitter.com/chiefscientist) posted an invitation to anyone interested in giving a talk about Swift for Tensorflow at [Scale By the Bay](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/). ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/gbnAQx7jOH4/b7D7Au6vBAAJ)).

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-25151](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25151): Fixes issues on user-defined derivatives for stored properties. As consequence user-defined derivatives for stored properties are no allowed and a name-correpondence is required between fields in `T.TangentVector` and `T`. Kudos to [Bart Chrzaszcz](https://twitter.com/bart_chr) for [this great PR write-up](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25151).

* [PR-25176](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25176): Refactors code that checks for satisfaction of generic differentiation requirements.

* [PR-24452](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24452): Moves out the module `Tensorflow` into the [swift-apis repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis). 

* [PR-24708](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24708): Fixes bug where SourceKit would not work with `.swiftinterface` files.

* [PR-25040](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25040): Puts in place checks to make sure `PythonLibrary.useVersion` is not called more than once.

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-158](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/158): Moves in all tests for `TensorGroup` from [swift repository](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/tensorflow).

* [PR-159](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/159): Introduces the Layers: `GlobalMaxPool1D`, `GlobalMaxPool2D` and `GlobalMaxPool3D`.

* [PR-156](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/156): Introduces `Tensor.gathering`.

* Adding support for the following operations: 

    * [PR-152](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/152): `tile`.
    * [PR-146](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/146): `expm1`.
    * [PR-145](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/145): `log1p`.
    * [PR-144](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/144): `sign`.

* [PR-141](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/141): Speeds up Tensor shape/rank operators by using TensorFlow Eager API.

* [PR-143](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/143): Refactors `matmul` operation so that it uses internally `Raw.batchMatMulV2`.

* [PR-109](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/109): Moves in the module `Tensorflow` from the [swift repository](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/tensorflow). 

* [PR-102](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/102): Brakes all code in `Layer.swift` into different files within a `Layers` directory.
