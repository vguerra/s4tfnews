## News and Articles

* The 1st release candidate for Swift for TensorFlow 0.12.0 is now available. Grab a copy from the [Release Candidate](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#release-candidates)'s section from the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md). The [S4TF v0.12 Release Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lP6euYS7k5zZAt1towGFpaopZ_PCzsMpFjBbA1Leakg) document guides you through all changes since v0.11, new changes and known issues. Please give this release a try and report any issues you find on [JIRA](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF) or GitHub issues on [Swift-APIs](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues).

* On Friday 6th of November, the 43rd SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Denys Shabalin](https://twitter.com/den_sh) gave an introductory talk about [Swift Benchmark](https://github.com/google/swift-benchmark): A Swift library for benchmarking code snippets. The slides of the presentation are available [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dx4aRhMnO4J5ylivfni_MM7Wqbxl0PP5/view?usp=sharing).

    You can find the notes for this meeting in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).

    Recording from this session is available [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BlRPZDLdQJD2oIfS7K2ekrntzJ2XQUHs/view?usp=sharing).


## The mailing list

* [Vojta Molda](https://twitter.com/vojtamolda) shared a nice library that will help you understand better shapes of your tensors: [Tensor Thumbnail](https://github.com/vojtamolda/tensor-thumbnail). ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/g/swift/c/raOBAwgOdMw/m/47m7bKouAgAJ)).
