* On Friday 30th of August, the 9th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. This time, it was all about Reinforcement Learning. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Anthony Platanios](https://twitter.com/eaplatanios) presented the RL projects he has been working on: [swift-rl](https://github.com/eaplatanios/swift-rl), [swift-ale](https://github.com/eaplatanios/swift-ale) and [swift-retro](https://github.com/eaplatanios/swift-retro). Find the slides of the presentation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MvElxjvyd7VoFdGoGt5KYjUnRsLS89lL/view?usp=sharing).

    * [Brennan Saeta](https://twitter.com/bsaeta) and [Marc Lanctot](https://twitter.com/sharky6000) talked about [OpenSpiel](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel) and the [Swift for Tensorflow port of it](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/tree/master/swift).

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-26848](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26848): Introduces `InMemoryFrontend` lib, which runs compilation and emits resulting module to a memory buffer, w/out writting to the file system.

* [PR-26827](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26827): Adds `zeroTangentVector` to `Differentiable` protocol. **Note**: Derivation for this property is not yet implemented.  Resolving partially Partially resolves [TF-708](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-708).

* Work on new protocol `EuclideanDifferentiable` protocol, which you can use for representing common differentiable data structures that contain both differentiable vector properties and other 
stored properties that do not have a derivative:

    * [PR-26900](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26900): Fixes crash on derived conformances. Resolves [TF-783](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-783).
    * [PR-26890](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26890): Derives `differentiableVectorView` property from member's vector views. Resolves [TF-785](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-785).
    * [PR-26867](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26867): Derives conformances to the protocol. Resolves [TF-777](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-777).
    * [PR-26827](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26827): Introduces `EuclideanDifferentiable` protocol.

* [PR-26826](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26826): Makes force-unwrapping differentiable. Resolves [TF-455](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-455).


#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-397](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/397): Fixes order of elements in returned tuple in VJP of `conv2DBackpropFilter` (`_vjpConv2DBackpropFilter`) as differentiation is w.r.t. `(x, input)`.

    * [PR-493](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/493): `ZeroPadding1D`, `ZeroPadding2D` and `ZeroPadding3D`.

    * [PR-493](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/493): `Embedding`.
