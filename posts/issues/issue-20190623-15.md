## News and Articles

* The second S4TF open design meeting took place last Friday 21st of June, 2019. Among the things discussed we have:
    
    * Upcoming release of Swift for Tensorflow v0.4 will be announced this week.

    * [Gogul Balakrishnan](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bgogul/) leaded the discussion on [design for Lazy Tensors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sb7t0FfbEl9KJkX4zrW358AkLH0TOTuLns0fPPh9JjU/edit).

    * There is a [migration guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dB3CiDRhVDTIcJjw4ClwJ9eTvIT0zVGPRsD_RJyaM5I/edit#heading=h.313ep4luyxd1) to help you out when moving from v0.3 to v0.4, to which you can contribute as well ü§ì.

    You can find the meeting notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).

* Swift for Tensorflow talks:

    * [Tanmay Bakshi](https://twitter.com/tajymany) gave a talk at the [Advanced Spark and Tensorflow meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Advanced-Spark-and-TensorFlow-Meetup/) about S4TF. He touches on it's strenghts and shows off some code examples (which you can find on [github](https://github.com/tanmayb123/Swift4TensorFlow-Examples)). You can watch the recording on [youtube](https://youtu.be/etxIKXJo3f4).

    * [Thom Mackey](https://twitter.com/thom_mackey) spoke at [Melbourne CocoHeads meetup](https://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/) about S4TF. You can watch the recording on [youtube](https://youtu.be/zJO9Jij0O9o).

* [Richard Wei](https://twitter.com/rxwei) has posted a [pre-pitch on the Swift Evolution](https://forums.swift.org/t/pre-pitch-swift-differentiable-programming-design-overview/25992) forums presenitng the design overview for [Differentiable Programming in Swift](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bPepWLfRQa6CtXqKA8CDQ87uZHixNav-TFjLSisuKag/edit?usp=sharing).

* [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) announced during the lasT S4TF Design meeting that a new [fast.ai](http://fast.ai) course [will be released on June 28th](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1142104776093495296) that is called: "Deep Learning from the Foundations", which includes lessons using Swift for Tensorflow (co-taught w/[Chris Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm)) üçæüëèüèº. 


## The mailing list

* [John D. Pope](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jdpope) shared a [github repository](https://github.com/johndpope/s4tf-style-transfer) containing an Xcode project implementing Neural Style Transfer in S4TF (coming from this [post](https://mc.ai/neural-style-transfer-with-swift-for-tensorflow/)). ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/O9a9-BPzSF0/9ruehxVeCQAJ)).

* [Ayush Agrawal](https://twitter.com/mantis0604) asks how to install OpenCV4 on Google Colab when it is a dependency for your code. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/qZZuBfJTVsg/2HpKkc5nCAAJ)).

* `rex-remind` asked on the mailing list for recommendations on the topic of Differential Geometry. If you are curious about this topic check out the recommendations. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/G_QkWhYiAjc/LJkqHGooBQAJ)).

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-25688](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25688): Enforces `@differentiable` closure converstion to be applied only when from-expression is a literal closure expression or a reference to a `func` declaration.

* [PR-25594](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25594): Allows you to reference parameters by index w.r.t order of appearence in original function in `wrt:` argument of attributes  `@differentiating` and `@differentiable`.

* [PR-25558](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25558): Introduces differentiation for loops.

* [PR-25552](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25552): Adds top-level `withoutDerivative(at:in:)` to support generic algorithms that are conditionally differentiable.

* [PR-25525](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25525): Adds broadcasting methods `adding(_:)` and `substracting(_:)` to protocol `VectorProtocol` which are compiler-derivable.

* [PR-25509](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25509): Adds support for diferentiation of `switch_enum` [terminator](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/SIL.rst#terminators). Differentiation of active enum values is not yet supported though.

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-150](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/150): Introduces `logSumExp` which is more numerically stable than `log(exp(self).sum(...))`.

* [PR-275](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/275): Adds support for dilated `Conv1D` and `Conv2D`.

* [PR-272](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/272): Makes 'Tensor.gathering' generic over `Int32` and `Int64`. 

* [PR-157](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/157): Adds support for 'Tensor.batchGathering(atIndices:)'.

* Added activation functions:

    * [PR-268](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/268): Adds Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation function `gelu(_:)`.

    * [PR-260](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/260): Adds leaky ReLU activation function `leakyRelu(_:alpha:)`.

    * [PR-252](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/252): Adds Exponential Linear Unit activation function `elu(_:)`.


* [PR-264](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/264): Introduces contribution guidelines.

* [PR-257](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/257): Adds `Embedding` layer.

* [PR-202](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/202): Extract traces for evaluating a `LazyTensorOperation`.

* [PR-197](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/197): Introduces Glorot normal initialization for `Tensor`. 

* [PR-251](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/251): Adds implementations for `adding(_:)` and `subtracting(_:)` of `VectorProtocol` protocol.

* [PR-241](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/241): Adds 2D depthwise convolution layer `DepthwiseConv2D`.

* [PR-227](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/227): Adds Logarithm-cosine loss `logCoshLoss(predicted:,expected:)`.

### Swift Jupyter

[PR-66](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter/pull/66): Introduces `%system` directive to install libraries before swift packages.
