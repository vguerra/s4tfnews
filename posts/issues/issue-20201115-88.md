## News and Articles

* The 2nd release candidate for Swift for TensorFlow 0.12.0 is now available. Grab a copy from the [Release Candidate](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#release-candidates)'s section from the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md). The [S4TF v0.12 Release Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lP6euYS7k5zZAt1towGFpaopZ_PCzsMpFjBbA1Leakg) document guides you through all changes since v0.11, new changes and known issues. Note that this time, we have release candidates for `Windows` and `NVIDIA Jetson, JetPack 4.4`. Please give this release a try and report any issues you find on [JIRA](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF) or GitHub issues on [Swift-APIs](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues).

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (main branch)

* [PR-34704](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/34704): Fixes differentiation transform crashers in library evolution mode.

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-34709](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/34709): Removes workaround for [SR-13820](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13820). Resolves [TF-1350](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-1350).

* [PR-34692](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/34692): Ensures configuring the build type for the `swift-apis`
build when building the toolchain. This ensures that we do not end up with debug mode binaries.

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-1122](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/1122): Adds support for importing Swift Numerics.

* [PR-1123](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/1123): Makes the `CTensorFlow` module more `SPM` friendly.

* [PR-1121](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/1121): Imports `_Differentiation` more thoroughly.

* [PR-1120](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/1120): Makes sure to build sub-modules (`swift-numerics` and `PythonKit`) with the same build config.

#### Swift Models

* [PR-695](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/695): Updates build docs for `Windows`.
