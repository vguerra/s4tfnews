## News and Articles

* On Friday 17th of July, the 36th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

	* [Andrey Volodin](https://twitter.com/s1ddok) presented [Sardonyx](https://github.com/s1ddok/Sardonyx): a CLI tool that converts your `ONNX` model into Swift code + structured data blob, making it easy for you to reuse models that were created using `PyTorch` or `TensorFlow`.

	Recording from this session is available [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M_akcTCyovGjjD5Ufq5uDqzmcWnzzrO6/view?usp=sharing)) as well.

	You can find the notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).


* New Development snapshots are available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow: [Xcode 11](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow-artifacts/macos-toolchains/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2020-07-16-a-osx.pkg).
