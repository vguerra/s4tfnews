## News and Articles

* This Issue marks one year of *Swift for TensorFlow Newsletter*. Thank you for your readings and support.

* The 1st release candidate for Swift for TensorFlow 0.8.0 is now available. Grab a copy from the [Release Candidate](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#release-candidates)'s section from the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md). The [S4TF v0.8 Release Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zjDwHBvIstW5Fp_08xM1VV24Dvt86ajC/edit#heading=h.2et92p0) document guides you through all changes since v0.7. Please give this release a try and report any issues you find on [JIRA](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF) or GitHub issues on [Swift-APIs](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues).

* On Friday 6th of March, the 25th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:
	
	* [Dan Zheng](https://twitter.com/dancherp) and [Marc Rasi](http://www.marcrasi.com/) gave an update on recent developments on Automatic Differentiation capabilities in the Swift Compiler. As well, they gave a live demo, showcasing `Differentiable Swift` on a [physics example](http://bit.ly/swift-physics-demo). You can find the slides for the presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Cf7IWFexM1xl-W_eN3uH_28wnNgCyZBaD_WKHcwmwsY).

	The notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).
