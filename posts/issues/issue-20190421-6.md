## News and Articles

* The first Swift for Tensorflow workshop is starting this 23rd of April in San Francisco at the Data Institute. The workshop is given by [Chris Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm) and [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward). If you are in San Francisco for the workshop dates, be sure to [register](http://rsvp.usfca.edu/events/fast-ai-swift-for-tensorflow-workshop-the-data-institute/event-summary-8472634ee3d24af6862968edfbb6dcae.aspx).

* [Josh Gordon](https://twitter.com/random_forests) sat with  [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) to talk about the plans [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) has for Swift for TensorFlow. Check out the [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drSpCwDFwnM).

* A new toolchain for macOS has been released on the 18th of April. You can download it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2019-04-18-a-osx.pkg)

## The mailing list

* [Anthony Platanios](https://twitter.com/eaplatanios) raised some issues he has been having related to Automatic Differentiation ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/a5vaC2GTY_w/rOHAlCzNCAAJ)).


* [Anthony Platanios](https://twitter.com/eaplatanios) asks about the lack of logical operators `.&&`, `.||`. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/K0C3ePC05UY/R8S7somQCwAJ)).


## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-24195](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24195): Improves install instructions with right version needed of Bazel.

* [PR-24191](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24191): `Tensor.expandingShape` supports `[Int]` or `Int` like its counterpart `Tensor.squeezingShape` does.

* [PR-24164](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24164): Fix throwing errors in backward pass for `sum(squeezinAxes:)` and `mean(squeezinAxes:)`.

* [PR-24120](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24120): Adds `split` Op for tensor.

* [PR-24122](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24122): Introduces first implementation of evolution proposal [SE-0253](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0253-callable.md) for callables. (This is actually a 2nd version, if you want to have a look at the first implementation that got reverted check out [PR-24086](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24086)).

* [PR-24096](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24096): Adds `splitV` which splits a Tensor along one dimention.

* [PR-23684](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/23684): Introduces advanced Indexing and Slicing for Tensors.

* [PR-23183](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/23183): Makes arrays differentiable.

* [PR-23777](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/23777): Adds `_TFCExecuteOp` which dispatches an eager op returning a Tensor group. As well, introduces raw operations: `saveV2` and `restoreV2` and `AnyTensor` protocol.

* The following PR's make APIs use `Int` instead of `Int32` or `Int64`: 
    * [PR-24012](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24012): Makes APIs use `Int` instead of `Int32`.
    * [PR-24110](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24110): Dataset API uses `Int` instead of `Int64`.

* [PR-23891](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/23891): Introduces `ConvertibleFromPython` protocol which defines conversion from `PythonObject`.

* [PR-24042](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24042): Standarizes numeric reduction Ops to have squeezing, along and nullary versions.

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-70](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/70): Introduces following improments to APIs:
    * Splits Operations into several files.
    * Adds the following initializers for `Tensor`: `Tensor(stacking:alongAxis:)`, `Tensor(concatenating:alongAxis:)`, and `Tensor(tiling:multiples:)` and `Tensor(rangeFrom:to:stride:)`.
    * Introduces following Operations: `Tensor.unstack()`, `Tensor.split(numSplits:alongAxis:)`, `Tensor.split(sizes:alongAxis:)`, `sigmoid(_:)`.

* [PR-105](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/105): Makes `LSTMCell` and `SimpleRNNCell` conform to `VectorNumeric`. As well, introduces a wrapper layer `RNN` to this cells: `SimpleRNN` and `LSTM` respectively.

* [PR-96](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/96): Introduces usage of `call func` ( as implemented by [SE-0253](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0253-callable.md)). With this change you don't have to use anymore the `applied` method on Layers, instead you do: `layer(input)`.

* [PR-97](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/97): Introduces the following Recurrent Layers: `SimpleRNNCell`, `LSTMCell`.

* [PR-95](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/95): Fixes array out-of-bounds errors you would get occasionally when running Optimizers. This removes as well the `scalarType` parameter in initializers. As well, allows experimentation by exposing some properties in optimizers: `Adam`, `RMSProp`, `SGD`.

* [PR-90](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/90): Renames `GlobalAveragePooling` to `GlobalAvgPool`.

* [PR-84](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/84): Makes APIs use `Int` instead of `Int32`.

* Improvements on Tests:
    * [PR-82](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/82): Unit tests for `GlobalAvgPool1D`, `GlobalAvgPool2D` and `GlobalAvgPool3D`.

    * [PR-89](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/89): Unit tests for `Flatten`, `Reshape` layers.

#### Swift Models

* [PR-108](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/108): Removes Python code from MNIST example.

* [PR-89](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/89): Adds wide ResNet 16 and 28 variants.
