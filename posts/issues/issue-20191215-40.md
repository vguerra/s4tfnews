## News and Articles

* The final release of Swift for Tensorflow v0.6 is now available ðŸŽ‰. Checkout the [release notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LihPvZRzbncMZtXnhhWzUNWzI_FOFee_RgcyjLjh6Cs/edit) to be aware of all changes. Grab one of the pre-built toolchains available [in the Install instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#releases) or give it a try in [Colaboratory](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Usage.md#colaboratory). As usual, feel free to report any issues in the mailing list [swift@tensorflow.org](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/swift), the [JIRA-bug tracker](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF) or [GitHub Issue tracker for Swift-APIs](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues).

* A new Xcode 11 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2019-12-12-a-osx.pkg).


## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-28787](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28787): Moves thunk generation utilities to `Utils/Differentiation/Thunk.h`.

* [PR-28772](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28772): Fixes derivative generic signature calculation when same-type requirements bind
all generic parameters to concrete types. Resolves [TF-1059](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-1059) and [](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-1062). 

* [PR-28761](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28761): Fixes syntax support for `@derivative` and `@transpose`. Resolves [TF-1009](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-1009).

* [PR-28735](): Puts the generic signature of the original function in the `DifferentiableAttribute`. Resolves [TF-1046](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-1046).

* [PR-28716](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28716): Forbids overly-constrained derivative requirement implementations.

* [PR-28717](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28717): Changes `@derivative` and `@transposing` type-checking to not reuse `@differentiable` diagnostics. Rename shared diagnostics to have a general name. Resolves [TF-998](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-998) and [TF-1051](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-1051).

* [PR-28699](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28699): Mangles derivative generic signatures for derivative functions. Resolves [TF-680](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-680) and [TF-1037](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-1037).

* [PR-28693](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28693): Adds `Array.zeroTangentVectorInitializer`, a closure that produces a `TangentVector` of zeros with the same `count` as `self`.

* [PR-28662](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28662): Makes sure that cloned curry thunks generated by differentiation create a `differentiable_function` instruction before any `dealloc_stack` instructions to prevent `alloc_stack`/`dealloc_stack` ordering issues.. Resolves [TF-1039](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-1039). 

* [PR-28621](http://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28621): Lowers directly @derivative attributes to differentiability witnesses during SILGen. Resolves [TF-835](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-835).
