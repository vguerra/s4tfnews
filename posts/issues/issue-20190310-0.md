## News and Articles

* [Version 0.2](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md) of the pre-built packages was released on March 1st.

* Check out the TensorFlow Dev Summit '19 presentation from [Chris Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm) and [Brennan Saeta](https://twitter.com/bsaeta) about Swift for Tensorflow: [The Next-Generation Machine Learning Framework](https://youtu.be/s65BigoMV_I). You can as well have a look at the notebooks used during the presentation on [github](https://github.com/saeta/s4tf-dev-summit-19). 

* During the TensorFlow Dev Summit '19 [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) announced that they will embrace Swift for Tensorflow in a couple of their lessons. Even more exciting: [Chris Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm) will be co-teaching them. Check out the [official announcement](https://www.fast.ai/2019/03/06/fastai-swift/) written by [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward).

* [Tanmay Bakshi](https://twitter.com/tajymany) has been sharing on [his youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqufIGIYauviVaKyJUzKvQw) great videos on how to use Swift for Tensorflow. Check them out! So far he's got: [Python interoperability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p64f6befZkw), a [CNN for digit classification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D-l7OGq83U) and [OpenAI-Unsupervised Sentiment Neuron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQX96CT8kkA).

* [Jacopo Mangiavacchi](https://twitter.com/JacopoMangia) has shared [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JacopoMangia/status/1102280988778913793?s=20) a bunch of sample notebooks showcasing Swift for Tensorflow, [check them out](https://github.com/JacopoMangiavacchi/Swift-TensorFlow-Sample-Notebooks).

* [Brad Larson](https://twitter.com/bradlarson) writes about his experience on [training AlexNet using Swift for TensorFlow](https://www.perceptuallabs.com/blog/2019/2/27/training-alexnet-using-swift-for-tensorflow). You can find his code on [github](https://github.com/BradLarson/AlexNet-Swift).


## The mailing list

* This year the Tensorflow project has been accepted as an official [open source mentor](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6137730124218368/) and among the [proposed ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zT57PFMGZ04A4CvHxAKVpMTgXjsO92_oKeSKwZMc0Gs/edit#heading=h.lfnnqlbxlyqh) to work on you can find 4 projects under the Swift for Tensorflow umbrella. Read all about it in the [official announcement](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/B3oWPZsaKi8/ks0nKYFaAQAJ) in the mailing list.

* [Richard Wei](https://twitter.com/rxwei) shared the [new project page](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/), [API documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs) and several tutorials that were released during the Tensorflow Dev Summit '19. ([original post](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/qeuNIwWdszE/7Q08n-x5CAAJ)).

* [Volodymyr Pavliukevych](https://medium.com/@volodymyr_87041) shared his swift package to track and visualize Tensors in Tensorboard. He is calling his package: [KrakenKit](https://github.com/KrakenCL/KrakenKit). ([original post](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/VIdzVMek-Fs/E08e6EU_BwAJ)).
