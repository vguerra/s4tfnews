## News and Articles

* [Joaquin Alori](https://twitter.com/JoaquinAlori) wrote a very thoughtful piece on Swift for TensorFlow on the [tryo labs blog](https://tryolabs.com/blog/). The article goes over some history of the project, its strenghts and what the current status of it is. Read it [here](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2020/04/02/swift-googles-bet-on-differentiable-programming/).

* Release of [SwiftPlot 2.0.0](https://github.com/KarthikRIyer/swiftplot/releases/tag/2.0.0) is now available. Among the new available features we have: Support for annotations and the ability to make Heatmaps.

* A new Xcode 11 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2020-04-07-a-osx.pkg).
