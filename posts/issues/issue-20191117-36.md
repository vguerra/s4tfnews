## News and Articles

* On Friday 15th of November, the 16th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Marc Rasi](http://www.marcrasi.com/) presented a tool called *ADPropertyTests* that he authored to 
[Randomly generate Test cases for Swift Automatic DIfferentiation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y6OpLSdeDAqsYiOtYaL5NJli3usV-BBaijhu17lDEX0/edit?usp=sharing). The design document for the tool is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y6OpLSdeDAqsYiOtYaL5NJli3usV-BBaijhu17lDEX0/edit#heading=h.pd8i88aydrf4) and you can as well checkout the tool's source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/tree/ad-property-testing/ADPropertyTests).

    You can find the meeting notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).
