## News and Articles

* On Friday 3rd of April, the 28th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

	* [Alex Suhan](https://github.com/asuhan) made a presentation on how Swift for TensorFlow runs on XLA devices (TPUs and GPUs). He took us on a deep dive on X10, which is an implementation of S4TF Tensor operations using XLA. His slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JpNbOq_N_qIWMPhzZ3o2Id5vDjHS8o5vtaGIU8VcSeA/edit?usp=sharing).

	Recording from this session is available [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ux-1SCxGmhJ4mGQ-mCSIuK0QCccREvhl/view?usp=sharing).
	
	As well, you can find the notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).

* You can now find Development Snapshots of S4TF with X10 support at the [Installation page](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JpNbOq_N_qIWMPhzZ3o2Id5vDjHS8o5vtaGIU8VcSeA/edit?usp=sharing).
