## The mailing list

* [Vova Manannikov](https://github.com/vvmnnnkv) shared [Fast Style Transfer Service with S4TF and Vapor](https://s4tf-style-transfer.herokuapp.com/), which is a serving service that uses a fast style transfer model written in Swift for Tensorflow (v0.5-rc0 to be exact ðŸ¤“). The API provided is very similar to the [Predict API](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/api_rest#predict_api) from [TF-Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving). You can have a look at the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/vvmnnnkv/s4tf-style-transfer-service). ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/topic/swift/yTi73Q9XCUI/discussion)).

* Heiko has worked on converting the [examples on Partial Differential Equations](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/non-ml/pdes) in TensorFlow to Swift for TensorFlow. You can find the resulting Swift code as attachments of the [conversation in the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/topic/swift/IKtbGzwx68A/discussion). ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/topic/swift/IKtbGzwx68A/discussion)).

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-27142](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27142): Reverts [27032](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27032) due to failures on tests for [`swift-apis`](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis).
