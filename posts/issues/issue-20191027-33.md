## News and Articles

* [Sanyam Bhutani](https://twitter.com/bhutanisanyam1) has released, this last weekend, two interviews on his [Chai Time Data Science](https://chaitimedatascience.com/) podcast that you should listen to:

    * An interview with [Dr. Marc Lanctot](https://twitter.com/sharky6000) where they talk all about Research at DeepMind, Deep Learning Research, AlphaGo, Swift For TensorFlow and OpenSpiel. Check out the video on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/-uUHR5VALB0).

    * An interview with [Bart Chrzaszcz](https://twitter.com/bart_chr) where they talk about his Google Software Engineering Internship, his contributions to Swift For TensorFlow and OpenSpiel. Check out the video on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/OTXKRPGhQu8).

* The [upstreaming effort](https://twitter.com/rxwei/status/1187923715436138496) to bring differentiable programming to the master branch of swift repository has started. All PRs related are prefixed with **[AutoDiff upstream]**.

* [Paige Bailey](https://twitter.com/dynamicwebpaige) was at [try! Swift NYC](https://twitter.com/tryswiftnyc) presenting Swift for TensorFlow. You can find the recording of her talk, Swift for TensorFlow - Machine Learning with no Boundaries, in [Youtube](https://youtu.be/xnwgifICYYA).

* On Friday 25th of October, the 14th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Edward Connell](https://github.com/ewconnell) presented [SwiftRT](https://github.com/ewconnell/swiftrt): A Tensor runtime layer to meet the high performance requirements of Swift for TensorFlow. On this 1st part of the presentation Edward went into the internals of the library. Stay tunned for the 2nd part.

    * [Dan Zheng](https://twitter.com/dancherp) has prorposed that all additions or changes to the API should be discussed before merging into the [swift-apis](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis) repo. Among the recent changes we have: 
        * [PR-529](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/529): TensorFlow checkpoint reader. 
        * [PR-319](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/319): Layer parameter initializers.

    * Last but not least, [Dan Zheng](https://twitter.com/dancherp) presented the upcoming [retroactive derivative registration](https://gist.github.com/dan-zheng/0e28c41dd0734fa6d3644e6ed0a9c16f), which will allow for definition of derivatives in different modules.

    You can find the meeting notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).
