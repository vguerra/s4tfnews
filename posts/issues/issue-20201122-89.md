## News and Articles

* The final release for Swift for TensorFlow 0.12.0 is now available. Grab a copy at the [Release](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#release-candidates)'s section from the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md). The [S4TF v0.12 Release Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lP6euYS7k5zZAt1towGFpaopZ_PCzsMpFjBbA1Leakg) document guides you through all changes since v0.11, new changes and known issues. Please give this release a try and report any issues you find on GitHub issues for [Swift-APIs](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues) repository.

* [Richard Wei](https://twitter.com/rxwei) has posted on the Swift Forums a pitch for support of Differentiable Programming in Swift. The proposal focuses on supporting machine learning applications as well as other gradient-based algorithms. Check out the pitch [here](https://forums.swift.org/t/differentiable-programming-for-gradient-based-machine-learning/42147).
