## News and Articles

* The 1st release candidate for Swift for TensorFlow 0.5.0 is now available (Ubuntu and Colab only, macOS package is coming soon!). Grab a copy from the [Release Candidate](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#release-candidates)'s section from the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md). The [S4TF v0.5 Migration Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8daaIFswkOwbhmdwLJ7NRWzX0uY9jMZYRfRH0EymV8/edit) document guides you through all changes since v0.4. Please give this release a try and report any issues on [JIRA](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF) you find.

* On Monday 9th of September at 6 PM (Pacific Time), the [Swift for TensorFlow](https://www.meetup.com/Swift-for-TensorFlow) meetup will host an event. The topic for this edition is [Swift as syntactic sugar for MLIR](https://www.meetup.com/Swift-for-TensorFlow/events/262262835/). The event is taking place at Google Developers Launchpad Space in San Francisco, CA. If you plan to attend, make sure you [reserve your place](https://www.meetup.com/Swift-for-TensorFlow/events/262262835/).

* [Richard Wei](https://twitter.com/rxwei) has posted in the Swift Evolution forums the proposal for [Differentiable Programming in Swift](https://forums.swift.org/t/differentiable-programming-mega-proposal/28547).

* [James Dellinger](https://twitter.com/jamrdell) has written an excellent guide on [Building and Training an XResNet from Scratch](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jamesdellinger/fastai_deep_learning_course_part2_v3/blob/master/13_swift_resnet_pipeline_s4tf_v04_my_reimplementation.ipynb?flush_cache=true).

* The 2019 edition of [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) has endeed and results have been announced this last 3rd September. Go to the [TensorFlow organization](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6137730124218368/?sp-page=2#4520326505955328) page to access the final submitions the students worked on.
