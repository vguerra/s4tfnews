## News and Articles

* On Friday 5th of June, the 33rd SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

	* [Denys Shabalin](https://twitter.com/den_sh) presented the current proposed design of the feature "Automatic Requirement Satisfaction" in plain Swift. You can find the respective pitch in the [Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/automatic-requirement-satisfaction-in-plain-swift/37158?u=victor_guerra). The slides are available [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_BC72FcmvtnrTPEwR75bNqE__rOPh7_I/view?usp=sharing).

	Recording from this session is available [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I5B6MlPkoapL1lpXTNzjBi5rdDzNd08o/view?usp=sharing).

	You can find the notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).


* A new Xcode 11 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2020-06-03-a-osx.pkg).
