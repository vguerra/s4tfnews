## News and Articles

* This week, [Chris Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm) was a guest on the show [TensorFlow Meets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5M4otA4S3A&list=PLQY2H8rRoyvyOeER8UNF-1zXaCKGLZVog). He sat together with [Laurence Moroney](https://twitter.com/lmoroney) to talk about Swift for TensorFlow. Check out the interview [online](https://youtu.be/z5M4otA4S3A).

## The mailing list

* [Hsing Liu](https://github.com/es2mac) shared a hobby project of his, where he uses Swift for TensorFlow to build AI that plays the game Tetris. Check out his progress on his github repo [here](https://github.com/es2mac/SwiftDigger). ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/nIVNOJ1RDYA/wcvfBTF7BgAJ))

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-25059](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25059): Fixes printing of `@differentiable` functions into `.swiftinterface` files.

* [PR-25051](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25051): Moves `TensorGroup` into the standard library.

* [PR-25054](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25054): Specifies needed versions of Bazel required to build with TensorFlow support: between v0.24.1 and v0.25.2 (inclusive).

* [PR-25023](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25023): Introduces `withDevice(named:perform:){}` which executes TensorFlow operations of a given closure on the named device.

* [PR-24976](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24976): Converts `_AnyTensorHandle` from class to protocol and introduces type `TFETensorHandle` which wraps a C pointer to `TensorHandle`.

* [PR-25031](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25031): Fixes bug when apply's result is active but arguments are not.

* [PR-24911](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24911): Initiates work on supporting differentiating control flow instuctions. `if` conditionals are supported.

* [PR-24966](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24966): Revamps infrastructure for TPU supoprt but this time on top of eager execution.

* [PR-24946](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24946): Cleans up `Differentiation` transform.

* [PR-24938](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24938): More clean-up in TensorFlow Compiler Runtime. Removes TPU support as it was designed to work with GPE. As well, removes `enableTPU`, `enableGPU` and `enableCPU`.

* [PR-24941](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24941): Fixes the issue where no `autodiff_function` is found when `VJPEmitter` produces the VJP function from original. 

* [PR-24879](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24879): Introduces flag `-enable-cxx-interop` and adds support for `extern "C" {}`.

* [PR-24907](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24907): Refactors unbroadcast operations so that it uses on-host axis calculation. This brings a speed-up of 37% when differentiating broadcasting operators, which translates to faster training.

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-131](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/131): Fixes `UpSampling3D` so that it works for high dimensional Tensors.

* [PR-133](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/133): Moves in `Dataset.swift`. 

* [PR-128](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/128): Adds `Conv3D` Layer.
