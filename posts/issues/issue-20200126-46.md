## News and Articles

* On Friday 24th of January, the 22nd SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Jacopo Mangiavacchi](https://twitter.com/jacopomangia) gave a lightning talk based on his recent [post](https://medium.com/@JMangia/swift-loves-tensorflow-and-coreml-2a11da25d44) on exporting Swift for TensorFlow models into CoreML. He has made his [slides](https://github.com/JacopoMangiavacchi/S4TF_CoreML_Test/blob/master/slides.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/JacopoMangiavacchi/S4TF_CoreML_Test) available.

    * [Sylvain Gugger](https://twitter.com/guggersylvain) continuing the descussions on input pipelines, he gave a tour of [`Batcher`](https://github.com/sgugger/SwiftData).


    You can find the [meeting recording](), notes  and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).
