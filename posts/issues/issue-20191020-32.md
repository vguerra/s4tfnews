## News and Articles

* [Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) [expressed on the Swift forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/trajectory-for-evaluating-adding-automatic-differentiation-to-swift/30048), on behalf of the [Core Team](https://swift.org/community/#community-structure), their interest in evaluating incorporating AD capabilities directly into the language. The #S4TF team has already put together a [plan to upstream AD features](https://gist.github.com/rxwei/80a51fdd59629d453d97f45d7e9a2cac) from #tensorflow branch to #master.

* [Mohd Sanad Zaki Rizvi](https://twitter.com/sanad_maker) has written [A Comprehensive Guide to Learn Swift from Scratch for Data Science](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/10/comprehensive-guide-learn-swift-from-scratch-data-science/). He writes about Swift basics and the feature of the language in the field of Data Science.

* The last [September 18th](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-London/events/264553990/), Olzhas Akpambetov, gave a talk at [TensorFlow London meetup](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-London/) on Swift for TensorFlow. Watch the recording of the talk [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl5LJhsdXC4).

* On Friday 18th of October, the 13th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Alex Suhan](https://github.com/asuhan) talked about [Swift binary size reductions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IQeUTwB5jHUeYglCysro2P4_lWTxTsccfNoWvCYMiNI/edit#slide=id.g65356c3b0c_0_0).

    * [Brennan Saeta](https://twitter.com/bsaeta) presented the design proposal docuemnt on [Layering Swift APIs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HO_sMhZJHxlDqw4Pjz4qva2s5yzgwxel-82yoK8O6L4/edit#heading=h.azcb89yf535y).

    You can find the meeting notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).
