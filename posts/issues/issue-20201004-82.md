## News and Articles

* On Friday 2nd of October, the 41st SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Vojta Molda](https://twitter.com/vojtamolda) gave an in-depth walkthrough of his Differentiable shallow water PDE solver [PR](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/666). Slides available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16alo-hc1mVIAd7sYb9NpzbKq9epNQUGn/view?usp=sharing).
    
    * [Brad Larson](https://twitter.com/bradlarson) went over one of his recent PRs: a Growing neural cellular automata ([PR](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/669)). A notebook showcasing the implementation is available [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/blob/8aa1f7b0810838a59503203e47e6d068147c3f4c/Examples/GrowingNeuralCellularAutomata/GrowingNeuralCellularAutomata.ipynb).

    You can find the notes for this meeting in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).

    Recording from this session is available [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yn8JqFOVpQuy4h9RPD-uSyIWfbp5Esz-/view?usp=sharing) as well.


* New Development snapshots are available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow: [Ubuntu 18.04 - CPU, Nightly](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow-artifacts/nightlies/latest/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-cuda11.0-cudnn8-ubuntu18.04.tar.gz) with `CUDA 11.0` support.
