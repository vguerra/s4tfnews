## News and Articles

* On Friday 7th of February, the 23rd SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

	* [Brad Larson](https://twitter.com/bradlarson) leaded the discussion on the ongoing efforts regarding model serialization and checkpointing. Checkout the presentation [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hC4LfND_INqU1X2LE9xaVgnTYpdkopmcX7_lClTAYq0/edit?usp=sharing).
	
	You can find the [meeting recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CTtMDuIiKcxoodoCutHx8WBjv40VTQRn/view?usp=sharing), notes  and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).

## The mailing list

* The `v0.7` release is underway. Respective branches were cut and first release candidate should be released soon. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/ikZQfGtIlro/ju7Xat_gAwAJ).)
