## News and Articles

* The 2nd release candidate for Swift for TensorFlow 0.11.0 is now available. Grab a copy at the [Release Candidate](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#release-candidates)'s section from the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md). The [S4TF v0.11 Release Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aTP88ANmJoxpxHeMIdz7CskqSuDHIg3mVELjm0iBXXQ/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs) document guides you through all changes since v0.10, new changes and known issues. Please give this release a try and report any issues you find on GitHub issues for [Swift-APIs](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues) repository.

* On Friday 14th of August, the 38th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Shadaj Laddad](https://twitter.com/ShadajL) did a follow up on his efforts trying to build a modern layer API ([related PR](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/630)). You can find the slides [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hBptP-JdNSRiHsLFX_jgPXahuuhgHlbt/view?usp=sharing)

    Recording from this session is available [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14FeYt4MpFiAw5uC5JCH82KxuOpLdkGwp/view?usp=sharing) as well.


* New Development snapshots are available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow: [Xcode 12](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow-artifacts/macos-toolchains/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2020-08-13-a-osx.pkg).
