## News and Articles

* A new tutorial is available that guides you through the parts of **Differentiable Swift** that are not so obvious ... yet. It is available at [Sharp edges in Differentiable Swift](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/tutorials/Swift_autodiff_sharp_edges).

* [Brett Koonce](https://twitter.com/asparagui) gave an introduction talk on Swift for TensorFlow during [GDG DevFest Cloud Kampala, Uganda](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-cloud-kampala-presents-gdg-devfest-uganda-2020-virtual-conference/). The [slides](https://brettkoonce.com/presentations/introduction_to_swift_for_tensorflow_2020.pdf) and [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSUFcX2dTjk) of the talk are now available online.

* New Development snapshots are available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow: [Windows](https://storage.googleapis.com/azure-pipelines-storage/Swift%20for%20TensorFlow/Windows/s4tf-windows-x64-41368-20201029.1.exe).
