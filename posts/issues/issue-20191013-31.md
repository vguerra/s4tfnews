## News and Articles

* The [Swift by Sundel](https://twitter.com/swiftbysundell) podcast has an episode on [Swift for Machine Learning](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/58/). [Paige Bailey](https://twitter.com/dynamicwebpaige) and [Brennan Saeta](https://twitter.com/bsaeta) joined [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) to talk about Machine Learning and all the exciting things happening in the Swift for TensorFlow project. You can listen the episode [here](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/58/).

* [Adam Paszke](https://twitter.com/apaszke) open sourced his library [Tensors Fitting Perfectly](https://github.com/google-research/swift-tfp), which is a *static analyzer for Swift programs that tries to detect tensor shape mismatches before you even attempt to run them*.  Adam [presented this library](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_AnKkTJwcbz6g_hBqY0b0NqgrKxPhclI/view) during the 11th Swift Design meeting.

* On Friday 11th of October, the 12th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * The GSoC'19 students that hacked the whole summer on Swift for TensorFlow projects, presented their results. Here the presentations that took place:

        * [SwiftPlot](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OaeXkfRI7KVHJ3w2hijj75KtOWxfdmm0QqQLsb039AQ/edit?usp=sharing) by [Karthik Ramesh Iyer](https://twitter.com/karthik_r_iyer): A data visualization library for Swift.
 
        * [SwiftML](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zX-mY3gAy8XvPMI6e0JJ-HS2xiQp80bNmzxQBCskU4U/edit?usp=sharing) by [Param Bhavsar](https://github.com/param087): On adding traditional ML algorightms to Swift for TensorFlow library.


    You can find the meeting [recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lLJ5w4fTx38tyjeuxIN6FMUcwi6HKdcd/view?usp=sharing) notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).
