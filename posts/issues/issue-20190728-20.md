## News and Articles

* The 4th release candidate of Swift for Tensorflow v0.4 is now available. Feel free to try it out in Colab or download a pre-built pacakge from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#releases).

* On friday 26th of July, the 4th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Anthony Platanios](https://twitter.com/eaplatanios) presented the work that has been done on [`Sequential` and `Embedding Layers`](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ux8-wmFBg-K9GHK-5zwIkEHPI8t0drAF7-OcQo4Zma0/edit#slide=id.p).

    * [Brad Larson](https://twitter.com/bradlarson) talked about the plans on refactoring [swift-models](http://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models) repository. Find the overview of the plan [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eIFrogM7HYn-hIMvrVcoOGjC15KCxDEyn60GNX1_DJI/edit#heading=h.2kwalj5sazl4).

    * [Parker Schuh](https://github.com/pschuh) leaded the discussion on [C++ Interoperability](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12AeCyY7pjRrzuQFWK0QLpjjDHkNInUfvHCwtEgF4lEM/edit?usp=sharing) and the progress that has been done on the topic. He shared an example showcasing how to enable C++ Interoperability ( see below in the mailing list section).

    You can find the meeting notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).

* [Julien Chaumond](https://twitter.com/julien_c) shared on [twitter](https://twitter.com/julien_c/status/1154771974213816321) the port, he and [Lysandre](https://twitter.com/LysandreJik) did, of OpenAI's GPT-2 to run on-device (using Swift and CoreML, not S4TF but still cool). Check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/huggingface/swift-coreml-transformers).

## The mailing list

* [Anthony Platanios](https://twitter.com/eaplatanios).  announced a nice list of packages he's been working on for Reinforcement Learning using Swift for Tensorflow:
    * [swift-rl](https://github.com/eaplatanios/swift-rl): Reinforcement Learning library with support for environments (e.g. OpenAI Gym) and RL Algorithms.
    * [swift-ale](https://github.com/eaplatanios/swift-ale): Interface to the [Atari Learning Environment](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment).
    * [swift-retro](https://github.com/eaplatanios/swift-retro): Interface to Gym Retro providing a swift-rl environment for Atari, Sega, etc.

* [Parker Schuh](https://github.com/pschuh) shared an example showcasing the amazing work that has been done on C++ Interoperability for Swift. Grab the sample from [Github](https://github.com/pschuh/cpp_example). ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/F8DDQBxi7yE/DkqWKNbiBQAJ))

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-26373](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26373): Moves utilities to check for memory leaks from tests in `AutoDiff/leakchecking.swift` to `DifferentiableUnittests`.

* [PR-26355](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26355): Fixes all memory leaks in differentiation of control flow. Resolves [TF-552](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-552).

* [PR-26345](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26345): Fixes two potential issues: usage of freed memory and a memory leak.

* [PR-26313](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26313): Fixes unexpected compilation error when differentiating protocol requirements with multiple `@differentiable` attributes. Resolves [TF-676](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-676).

* [PR-26050](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26050): Enables differentiation of class's methods. Reslves ([TF-631](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-631)).

* [PR-26292](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26292): Fixes compiler crash when generating param subset thunk for a partially-applied function. Adds as well diagnostics for differentiation of direct method references. [TF-675.](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-675).

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-396](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/396): Improves messages on deprecated funtions by adding migration instructions.

* [PR-391](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/391): Enables usage of control flow AD in `Layer`s: `BatchNorm` and `Dropout`. Introduces as well utility `withTensorLeakChecking { ... }` for checking memory leaks. Resolves [#389](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues/389).

* [PR-346](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/346): Introduces the `Module` protocol, which is equivalent to `Layer` before this PR but with no contraints on `Input`. `Layer` protocol now conforms to newly introduced `Module`. As well, `Embedding` now conforms to `Module` and `Sequential` has been adapted to work with both `Module`s and `Layer`s ( with the former restricted to appear only at the beginning of the chain).

* [PR-356](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/356): Introduces the `reduction` parameter for Losses which is a Reduction to be applied on the element-wise loss values. As well, makes some instances of `Tensor.max()` and `Tensor.min()` `@differentiable`.

* [PR-387](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/387): Makes `useLazyTensor` a Thread-local state.

* [PR-384](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/384): Uses `.moments(:)` to compute the mean and variance within `LayerNorm` and `BatchNorm` `Layer`s. As well, adds tests for both of them. 

* [PR-381](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/381): Uses `LazyTensor` explicitly to extract traces.

* [PR-377](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/377): Introduces experimental support for installation of Tensorflow into a Swift toolchain.

* [PR-380](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/380): Adds tests for `Dense` Layer.

#### Swift Models

* [PR-181](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/181): Adds a non-convolutional GAN example on MNIST.

* [PR-179](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/issues/179): Replaces Autoencoder's activation function with `sigmoid`. Resolves [#179](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/issues/179).

* [PR-178](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/178): Makes usage of Swift (instead of Python) for downloading and parsing of CIFAR10 dataset. 

#### Swift for Tensorflow Docs

* [fe3dfd72](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/commit/fe3dfd72): Updates notebook `install_latest_swift.ipynb` so that artifacts are fetched from `https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow-artifacts/nightlies/latest/...`.

* [PR-217](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/pull/217): Updates instructions to use Swift for Tensorflow toolchain within Xcode.
