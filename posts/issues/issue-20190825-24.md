## News and Articles

* On Friday 23rd of August, the 8th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) gave an introduction and overview of [`SwiftAI`](https://github.com/fastai/swiftai), formerly known as `Harebrain`. , which is a library modeled after [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) that aims to provide high-level APIs for Swift for Tensorflow.
    
    * The meeting recording is already available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QVJejwLGJ6Yc_H_k3SZmgmH77Y3CFSuD/view?usp=sharing), as well as the recordings for the [7th](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12HZsH58EtOT9EiYODeXf0mc874AhzRKC/view?usp=sharing) and [6th](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WbcXuY4tMZVxne6Vwgl9erWlN1gZJMjy/view?usp=sharing) meetings.

* The SwiftAI Contributors Group held the 1st meeting this past Monday 19th of August. The purpose of the groups is to serve as support for it's participants in contributions to the SwiftAI library. They will be meeting every Monday from now on from 6pm - 7pm (PST).

## The mailing list

* [Cristian Garcia](https://github.com/cgarciae) has proprosed in the mailing list improvements to the Subscript API. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/FEJ4FzZXT78/zq679G0DAgAJ)).


## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-26801](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26801): Speeds up building S4TF toolchains by using `sccache`. 

* [PR-26762](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26762): Refactors implementations of `shouldBeDifferentiated` that existed in `LinearMapInfo`, `JVPEmitter` and `VJPEmitter`, fixing logic in conditions to be checked and consolidating logic into consice APIs in `LinearMapInfo`.  Resolves [TF-653](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-653).

* [PR-26057](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26057): Introduces initial support for Forward Mode Automatic Differentiation, to activate it use `-Xllvm -run-jvp-generation` when running your Swift code.

* [PR-26737](http://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26737): Fixes the following bugs on `Array` litereal differentiation:
    * Memmory leak.
    * Production of zero derivatives for values of non-trivial loadable types in OSSA.

    Resolves [TF-706](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-706).


#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

    Partially solving [Issue-402](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues/402).

#### Swift Models

* [PR-188](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/188): Introduces loading and saving of `JPEG`s via Raw TensorFslow operations. As a result, `Matplotlib` dependency has been dropped from some examples.
