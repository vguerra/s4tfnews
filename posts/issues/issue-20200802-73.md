S4TF News - Issue 73, August 2nd 2020
===================

Welcome to the Issue #73 of *Swift for TensorFlow Newsletter*. A newsletter letter that summarizes weekly activity around the Swift for TensorFlow project.

Enjoy!

---

## News and Articles

* New Development snapshots are available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow: [Xcode 11](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow-artifacts/macos-toolchains/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2020-07-29-a-osx.pkg).

## The mailing list

* [Jonathan Simmons](https://twitter.com/JLHLonline) shared a small library he wrote called [PythonLambda](https://github.com/jrsonline/PythonLambda). It works together with [PythonKit](https://github.com/pvieito/PythonKit) to support `Python` lambdas from `Swift` code. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/7Irp-2c1ibg/FLfMWguzAwAJ)).
