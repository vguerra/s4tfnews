## News and Articles

* A new Xcode 11 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2019-12-21-a-osx.pkg).

* On Friday 20th of December, the 18th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Brett Koonce](https://twitter.com/asparagui) gave a talk on using Swift for Tenorflow and MLIR to build and deploy ML models to mobile devices. You can find the slides for the talk [here](http://static.brettkoonce.com/presentations/machine_learning_mobile_recap.pdf).

    You can find the meeting notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).

* You can now finally [create Colab notebooks](https://twitter.com/bsaeta/status/1209167695679090688) for Swift.
