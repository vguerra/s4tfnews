## News and Articles

* The first S4TF open design meeting took place last Friday 14th of June, 2019. A total of 100 people joined the meeting ( 94 of them did it remotely üë©‚Äçüíªüë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª). You can find the meeting notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4). As well, the recording is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17zkAakpgAXmsZSFBS4XYCi5zwBv-CQVQ/view). During this meeting [Richard Wei](https://twitter.com/rxwei) presented [the design document for automatic differentiation within Swift](https://t.co/DuNRtQgHU2). The next open meeting is scheduled for this coming Friday 21st of June, 2019 @ 4 pm UTC. This time the design discussion will be around *Lazy Tensors*. Please consider joining!

* [Param Bhavsar](https://github.com/param087) has [shared](https://forums.fast.ai/t/machine-learning-library-in-swift/47866?u=vguerra) the GSoC'19 project he and Victor Antony will be working on: Adding traditional Machine Learning algorithms to Swift for Tensorflow. You can follow the evolution of their project [here](https://github.com/param087/swiftML).

* **_Correction: This post in swift forums dates back from 2018, not from May 18th 2019._** ~~Back in May 18th~~, [Marc Rasi](http://www.marcrasi.com/) shared in the Swift forums a proposal for having [Compile-Time Constant Expressions for Swift](https://forums.swift.org/t/compile-time-constant-expressions-for-swift/12879) which would enable other features in the language that need compile-time execution. The ability to have compile-time constant expressions might come handy in some places within the Swift for Tensorflow project (see proposal) . You can find the proposal draft [here](https://gist.github.com/marcrasi/b0da27a45bb9925b3387b916e2797789).

* A new Xcode 10 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2019-06-13-a-osx.pkg).
