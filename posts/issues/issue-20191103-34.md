## News and Articles

* [Jacopo Mangiavacchi](https://twitter.com/jacopomangia) has [shared](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/I2_Z7F6MseA/hTFttLa0EwAJ) his [SwiftTFRecords](https://github.com/JacopoMangiavacchi/SwiftTFRecords) library, which facilitates producing and importing data in the TFRecords format directly in Swift.

* The design document for [SwiftRT](https://github.com/ewconnell/swiftrt), a high-peformance Tensor runtime layer presented by [Edward Connell](https://github.com/ewconnell) during last SIG Swift Design meeting, is now available [](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IasqA1EPrl3XB1QwNdwtVSe7RfZYnIHFUtyCtWlMDx0/edit?usp=sharing).

* [Paige Bailey](https://twitter.com/dynamicwebpaige) and [Brennan Saeta](https://twitter.com/bsaeta) were present at [TensorFlow World 2019](https://conferences.oreilly.com/tensorflow/tf-ca) the past week to talk about [Swift for TensorFlow - From the Foundations](https://conferences.oreilly.com/tensorflow/tf-ca/public/schedule/detail/79323). Check out the recording, which is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FWsSGD6V8Q).

* As well, during [TensorFlow World 2019](https://conferences.oreilly.com/tensorflow/tf-ca), [Mars Geldard](https://twitter.com/themartianlife), [Tim Nugent](https://twitter.com/The_McJones), and [Paris Buttfield-Addison](https://twitter.com/parisba) ran a tutorial titled [Swift for TensorFlow in 3 hours
](https://conferences.oreilly.com/tensorflow/tf-ca/public/schedule/detail/78523). You can find the material used for this tutorial on [GitHub](https://github.com/AIwithSwift/TFWorld2019-SwiftIn3Hours).

* Nightly development snapshopts of Swift for TensorFlow are now available for Ubuntu 18.04 (CUDA 10.1). You can find then in the [Development Snapshots](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#development-snapshots) section of the install instructions.


## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-27971](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27971): Makes `Array.DifferentiableView` unconstrained which allows to re-enable `ParseableInterface` tests. Resolves [TF-489](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-489). 

* [PR-27985](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27985): Makes sure to store original declaration in `DifferentiableAttr` to ease resolution of parameter indices.

* [PR-27988](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27988): Cleans up the type-checking for `@transposing` attribute.

* [PR-27923](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27923): Enables `LoadableByAddress` IRGen transformation.

* [PR-27919](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27919): Makes sure that `DifferentiabilityWitnessFunctionInst` stores a pointer to the witness. 

* [PR-27918](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27918): Renames `TransposingAttr::getParameterIndexSubset` to `TransposingAttr::getParameterIndices`.

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-538](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/538): Adds constraint `Element: Differentiable` to `Array.DifferentiableView` exntentions.
