## News and Articles

* [S5TF Team](https://twitter.com/s5tfteam) has [annouced the v.0.0.1 release](https://twitter.com/s5tfteam/status/1222675637548257280?s=20) of their libraries, written completely in Swift. Their goal is to make working with Swift for TensorFlow even easier. Check them out at https://s5tf-team.github.io/.

* A new Xcode 11 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2020-02-03-a-osx.pkg).

## The mailing list

* [Ewa Matejska](https://twitter.com/ematejska) starting a discussion regarding the support for `Python 2` and the strategy to be followed. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/MJLx6oWD1R8/4xh30YwnAQAJ))

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-29590](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/29590): Speeds up compile time by 3.5x by caching derivative function types. Resolves [TF-1133](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-1133).

* [PR-29564](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/29564): Fixes undiagnosed active `modify` accessor applications. . Resolves [TF-1115](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-1115). 

* [PR-29541](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/29541): Adds `SILFunctionType` method assertion.

* [PR-29543](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/29543): Makes `@noDerivative` attribute imply non-varying semantics. Now, `@noDerivative` can be declared on all function-like declarations:
`func`, `var`, `init`, and `subscript`.

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-657](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/657): Conforms all RNN cell `State` structs to the same protocols.

* [PR-653](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/653): Adds documentation to `Sequential`.

* [PR-651](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/651): Adds support for installing the package by extending the `CMake` build system.

* [PR-650](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/650): Removes bad api usage in eager runtime.

#### Swift Models

* []()

* [PR-292](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/292): Fix the shape of the last dense layer in `Resnet18` and `ResNet34`.

* [PR-287](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/287): Minor tweaks to the Gym models to allow for easier import internally.
