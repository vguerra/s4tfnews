## News and Articles

* The 1st release candidate for Swift for TensorFlow 0.11.0 is now available. Grab a copy from the [Release Candidate](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#release-candidates)'s section from the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md). The [S4TF v0.11 Release Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aTP88ANmJoxpxHeMIdz7CskqSuDHIg3mVELjm0iBXXQ/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs) document guides you through all changes since v0.10, new changes and known issues. Please give this release a try and report any issues you find on [JIRA](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF) or GitHub issues on [Swift-APIs](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues).

* Two new notebooks have been added to the [tensorflow/swift](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift) repository:

	* [Swift & Value Semantics](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/notebooks/value_semantics/01_value_semantics_in_swift.ipynb): A walk through examples on consuming/producing value-semantic APIs.

	* [Swift Value Semantics and Differentiable Programming](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/notebooks/value_semantics/02_value_semantics_and_autodiff.ipynb): An introduction into Differentiable Programming in Swift and how Swift Value Semantics enable efficient differentiation.

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (master branch)

* [PR-32963](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/32963): Fixes a bug on registered derivative for `*` operation of `SIMD`s (`_jvpMultiply`).

* [PR-33057](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/33057): Starts `linear_function` canonicalization skeleton. For now, transpose function operands are filled in with `undef`. 

* [PR-32916](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/32916): Removes remaining concrete derivative generic signatures.

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-1045](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/1045): Builds `PythonKit` rather than expect it to be provided.

#### Swift Models

* [PR-646](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/646): Shifts `x10` transformations from the `BERT-CoLA` example into the `CoLA` dataset.

* [PR-647](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/647): Removes `Batcher`.

* [PR-634](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/634): Adds documentation on how to add new `String`-typed settings for benchmarks.

* [PR-644](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/644): Introduces support for `electra`.

* [PR-642](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/642): Removes `camelCase` overrides for `benchmark` arguments. Resolves [Issue-636](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/issues/636).
