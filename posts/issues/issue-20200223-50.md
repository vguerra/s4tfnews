## News and Articles

* The final release for Swift for TensorFlow 0.7.0 is now available. Grab a copy from the [Release Candidate](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#release-candidates)'s section from the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md). The [S4TF v0.7 Release Notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QdBFCyS1RstReztwVEGNJsLY8fHAPfxv/view) document guides you through all changes since v0.6. 

* A new Xcode 11 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2020-02-19-a-osx.pkg).

* Once again, TensorFlow has been chosen as a [mentoring organization](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5907771876179968/) for [Google Summer of Code edition 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Here you have the list of propossed ideas for [Swift for TensorFlow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zT57PFMGZ04A4CvHxAKVpMTgXjsO92_oKeSKwZMc0Gs/edit#heading=h.aj1ygb6xda0n) ( as well, you are encouraged to propose your own ideas ). If you would like to apply, have a look at this year's edition [timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline).
