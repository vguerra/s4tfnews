## News and Articles

* On Friday 11th of September, the 39th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * GSoC 2020 students that developed projects for S4TF presented their final resutls:

        * [Ayushi Tiwari](https://github.com/ayushi2103) presented a [fast Image Loader for S4TF](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gOHRwCkBdBtq6cfhPLppJ6IO3FWxOTHma1G05pbd_-0/edit?usp=sharing).
        * [Seungjae Ryan Lee](https://twitter.com/seungjaeryanlee) presented [Deep-Q-Networks](https://www.endtoend.ai/tutorial/s4tf-dqn/) and [PPO](https://www.endtoend.ai/tutorial/s4tf-ppo/) implementations on S4TF.
    
    You can find the notes for this meeting in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).

## The mailing list

* [Brad Larson](https://twitter.com/bradlarson) announced the new experimental S4TF toolchains that targets the Nvidia Jetson single-board computers. He shared as well inital benchmarks using the `LeNet-MNIST`. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/g/swift/c/nDhOjbLTQuQ/m/SH6K_NGdCgAJ))

* [Vojta Molda](https://twitter.com/vojtamolda) shared his expirience working on a small differentiable partial differential equation (PDE) solver. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/g/swift/c/UadyIYNEBoM/m/1vvzHeRcAgAJ)). NOTE: Make sure you watch the entire animation he shared in the message.

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (master branch)

* [PR-33898](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/33898): Fixes forward-mode differentiation ownership verification failure. Resolves [SR-13530](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13530). 

* [PR-33728](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/33728): Splits large file `forward_mode.swift` into 3 smaller files. 

* [PR-33633](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/33633): Fixes forward-mode crashes related to tangent buffers. Resolves [TF-984](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-984) and [SR-13447](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13447). 

* [PR-33854](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/33854): Makes the differentiation transform generate transparent, ossa reabstraction thunks. Resolves [TF-989](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-989) and [SR-13390](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13390).


#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-1076](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/1076): Converts more xla ops to be generated from a spec.

* [PR-1067](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/1067): Adds support for model summaries by adding an additional protocol requirement to Module and Layer. This enables the addition of tensor annotations within callAsFunction() and lays the groundwork for additional hooks.

* [PR-1073](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/1073): Adds specs for assorted ops.
