## News and Articles

* The final release for Swift for TensorFlow 0.10.0 is now available. Grab a copy from the [v0.10 Release](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#release-candidates)'s section from the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md). The [S4TF v0.10 Release Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_EeREdz8jZ44zGXY-5m2-1xcR9pOvMZf4kkHfUgNjD0/edit) document guides you through all changes since v0.9, new changes and known issues. Please give this release a try and report any issues you find on [JIRA](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF) or GitHub issues on [Swift-APIs](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues).

* On Friday 26th of June, the 34th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

	* [Shadaj Laddad](https://www.shadaj.me/) presented the work behind a new API for `Layer` initialization ([PR](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/584)). He went over the thoughts behind its design and considered alternatives. The slides are available [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DKxFPMGFlRYjKzlnOxp8mwCdBhDYw8uD/view?usp=sharing).

	Recording from this session is available [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QqJsdbegRKI5-ftYOd0FkLJVA74hh1te/view?usp=sharing).

	You can find the notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).


* New Development snapshots are available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow: [Xcode 11](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2020-06-25-a-osx.pkg) and [Windows](https://storage.googleapis.com/azure-pipelines-storage/Swift%20for%20TensorFlow/Windows/s4tf-windows-x64-34189-20200623.1.exe).
