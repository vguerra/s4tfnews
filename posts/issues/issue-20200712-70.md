## News and Articles

* On Friday 10th of July, the 35th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

	* [Brad Larson](https://twitter.com/bradlarson) leaded the discussion on two topics: 1. A generalized Training Loop: its implementation, the questions still open and the next steps. 2. A higher-level checkpoint interfce: The current draft of the implementation and the next steps. You can find the slides available [online](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BX7wqe_b0QSt5hw_70H8uMJvtOZGPeKXYjWmRqEXOvk/edit#slide=id.g8bbea95af6_0_0).

	Recording from this session is available [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10udIXOtl4_BtqciCQy0pdvUsEnNqwKhl/view?usp=sharing) as well.

	You can find the notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).
