## News and Articles

* [William Zhang](https://github.com/WilliamHYZhang) has created a beginner-friendly tutorial for Swift for TensorFlow and SwiftPlot. Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/WilliamHYZhang/swiftplot/blob/notebook_addition/Notebooks/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Swift%20for%20TensorFlow%20and%20SwiftPlot.ipynb).

* On Friday 3rd of January, the 19th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Troy Harvey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/troy-aaron-harvey/) from [PassiveLogic](https://twitter.com/passivelogic) spoke about the work the company has been doing on top of Swift for Tensorflow specially on their extensions on KeyPaths.

    You can find the meeting notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).


## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-28930](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28930): Replaces SIMD use of `@differentiable(jvp:vjp:)` with `@derivative(of:)`.

* [PR-28935](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28935): Fixes `@derivative(of: subscript)` crash for `SIMD{n}` types. Resolves [TF-1090](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-1090).

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-601](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/601): Adds precondition to `matmul` to check that `Tensor` has at least rank 2. Partially resolves [Issue-517](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues/517). 

* [PR-602](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/602): Fixes a bug in `VJP` of `transposed(permutation:)`.

#### Swift Models

* [PR-270](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/270): Enables user inputting source url while creating `CIFAR10`.

* [PR-261](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/261): Introduces `DCGAN`.
