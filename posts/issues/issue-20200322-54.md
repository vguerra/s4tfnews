## News and Articles

* On Friday 20th of March, the 26th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:
	
	* A lot of exciting announcements were done during this last SIG Swift Design meeting. Among them: Performance and Accelerators ( TPU, XLA and a neat notebook-demo of GPT-2 on TPU), the new support in Differentiable Swift for `inout` parameters, checkpointing of models, better support in S4TF toolchains for macOS and Windows. The [recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gI6Zk2jS0-MNkckYBnRFNtVCHoGKHWct/view?usp=sharing) of this sessions is already available, as well as the [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zncjFqat4jMGdIErO7LJeXPUyoP-K9-i/view?usp=sharing).

	You can find the notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).

* [Jacopo Mangiavacchi](https://twitter.com/jacopomangia) published on Medium an article named [CoreML on-device training with Transfer Learning from Swift for TensorFlow models](https://medium.com/@JMangia/coreml-on-device-training-with-transfer-learning-from-swift-for-tensorflow-models-b66004eb3068) where he showcases [SwiftCoreMLTools](https://github.com/JacopoMangiavacchi/SwiftCoreMLTools): A library that mimics in Swift a subset of the functionalities of the official Apple CoreMLTools written in Python. In this article, Jacopo is using Transfer Learning techniques, where he reuses Embedding representations, coming from a previously trained model, in a brand new model trained from scratch on Apple devices. There is even a demo accompanying the post: [CoreML-TransferLearning-Demo](https://github.com/JacopoMangiavacchi/CoreML-TransferLearning-Demo/blob/master/README.md).


* A new Xcode 11 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2020-03-20-a-osx.pkg).
