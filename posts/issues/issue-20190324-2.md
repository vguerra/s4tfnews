## News and Articles

* Back in November 2018, during the [2018 Bay Area LLVM Developer's Meeting](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2018-10/), [Mingsheng Hong](https://twitter.com/mingshenghong) and [Chris Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm) talked about Graph Program Extraction ([GPE](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/GraphProgramExtraction.md)) and Device Partitioning within Swift for Tensorflow. You can watch the [video](https://youtu.be/HSneJdPkaKk) of the talk and have a look at the [slides](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2018-10/slides/Hong-Lattner-SwiftForTensorFlowGraphProgramExtraction.pdf%22) ðŸ“º.

* [Meghan Kane](https://twitter.com/meghafon) will be speaking at [SwiftAverio](https://twitter.com/SwiftAveiro/status/1109134071878299648) this coming June about *Getting Started with Swift for Tensorflow*. We are looking forward to the talk ðŸ˜Š.

## The mailing list

* [Richard Wei](https://twitter.com/rxwei) and [Dan Zheng](https://twitter.com/dancherp) wrote a pitch for Swift Evolution that aims to introduce [static callables](https://gist.github.com/rxwei/5986ab3c9d705f0560e8532d0650c7db) in the language. This would greatly help to make the Swift for Tensorflow APIs easier to use and clearer to read. Check out the post in the Swift forums [here](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-introduce-static-callables/21732).

* If you are contributing (or looking to) to the compiler, here are two links that you definitely need to check out: [Debugging the Compiler](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/tensorflow/docs/DebuggingTheCompiler.rst) and this post in the Swift Forums about [development workflow advice](https://forums.swift.org/t/need-a-workflow-advice/12536/14?u=dan-zheng). [[original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/lE4FZdV2c1Y/DjsjMbZZAQAJ)].

* [Karthik Ramesh Iyer](https://github.com/KarthikRIyer) is making great progress on his proposal for the GSoC 2019 Data Visualization Project. Several memebers of the community have jumped in giving great advice. Have a look at the [conversation](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/mWdf5HnEO1I/XVNhENCiAQAJ) for details.

## Starter bugs

Looking to contribute to the project? Have a look at the currently open [Starter Bugs]():
