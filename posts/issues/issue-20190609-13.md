## News and Articles

* Progress on Google Summer of Code 2019 projects:

    * [Ayush Agrawal](https://twitter.com/mantis0604) is working on a set of tutorials for Swift for Tensorflow that target beginner and intermediate users. You can find the notebooks he's been working on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ayush517/S4TF-Tutorials). As well, he's sharing the evolution of his project on [Medium](https://medium.com/gsoc-19) in case you want to follow closely his progress. ([original post](https://forums.fast.ai/t/swift-for-tensorflow-tutorials-guides/47430?u=vguerra)).

    * [Karthik Ramesh Iyer](https://github.com/KarthikRIyer)'s project is to develop a data visualization library in Swift. His library is called [SwiftPlot](https://github.com/KarthikRIyer/swiftplot). ([original post](https://forums.fast.ai/t/data-visualization-library-in-swift/46995?u=vguerra)).

* [Rahul Bhalley](https://twitter.com/rahul_bhalley) has shared his implementation of [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) in Swift for Tensorflow. Check out his article on [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/wasserstein-gan-in-swift-for-tensorflow-61b557bd8c63) and the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/rahulbhalley/swift-for-tensorflow-examples). 

* [Paige Bailey](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige) is now a [Product Manager for TensorFlow](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/1134543898007597056) focusing, among other topics, on Swift for TensorFlow.

* A new Xcode 10 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2019-06-06-a-osx.pkg).


## The mailing list

* [Paige Bailey](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige) has announced the founding of Swift SIG: a [Swift for Tensorflow Special Interest Group](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/sigs/swift/CHARTER.md). The first open meeting will take place this June 14th @ 4 pm UTC. You can find the agenda [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit). In case you wonder what a SIG is, have a look [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/community/sig_playbook) and [here](https://medium.com/tensorflow/contributing-to-tensorflow-sigs-rfcs-testing-and-docs-1c0f8240166c) .([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/MskgzFbItaI/WSX-p3vxBAAJ)).

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* Partial fixes on memory leaks:
    * [PR-25300](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25300): Adjoint memory leak.
    * [PR-25294](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25294): Control flow automatic differentiation memory leak.

* [PR-25268](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25268): Optimizes adjoint buffers for address projections as they become projections into their adjoint base buffer.

* Adding `linear` argument to attribues `@differentiable` and `@differentiating`: 
    * [PR-25269](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25269): Reflects whether functions are marked as linear or not. Serializes/Desrializes the argument.
    * [PR-25228](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25228), [PR-25257](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25257): Add ability to handle `linear` argument for `@differentiable` attribute when parsing.

* [PR-25273](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25273): Enables control flow automatic-differentiation by default.

* [PR-25255](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25255): Unifies block generation logic as handling entry adjoint block  generation in automatic-differentiation for control flow does not differ much from the general one.

* [PR-25057](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25057): Adds support for differentiation of conditionals, allowing to differentiate nested conditionals, recursion and `var` allocations of Tuples and Structs.

* [PR-25235](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25235): Following decisions on naming conventions for [SE-0253](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0253-callable.md) this replaces `func call` with `func callAsFunction`.

* [PR-25239](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25239): Removes all TensorFlow related tests as they have been migrated to [swift-apis repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis).

* [PR-25238](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25238): Removes `TensorGroup` tests for derived conformances as they have been moved already to [swift-apis repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis).


#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* Work on Hinge losses:
    * [PR-187](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/187): Adding Squared Hinge Loss.

    * [PR-185](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/185): Adding Hinge Loss function.

* [PR-182](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/182): Adds `meanAbsoluteError`.

* [PR-173](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/173): Introduces `LazyTensor` and `LazyTensorOperation` types.

* [PR-168](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/168): Refactors and renames convolution and poolong operators to improve discoverability.

* [PR-176](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/176): Converts `copy(of:)` to an extention method of `TensorHandle` named `makeCopy()` to avoid function lookup errors.

* [PR-172](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/172): Following decisions on naming conventions for [SE-0253](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0253-callable.md) this replaces `func call` with `func callAsFunction`.

* [PR-169](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/169): Enables compatibility with TPUs by changing seed type from `Int64` to `Int32`.

* [PR-165](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/165): Introduces new requirements to `TensorArrayProtocol` and `TensorGroup` to use `_AnyTensorHandle`.
