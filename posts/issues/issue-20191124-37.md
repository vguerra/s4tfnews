## News and Articles

* Last September [Brett Koonce](https://twitter.com/asparagui) gave a talk at [Kirkland ML Summit 2019](https://events.withgoogle.com/ml-summit-19-seattle/agenda/) titled *Convolutional Neural Networks with Swift*. The recording of the talk is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6jZUYjHaWI). Among the examples he shows on this talk, you can find [swift MNIST](https://github.com/huan/swift-MNIST), which is a Swift Package for the [MNIST Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database).

* The 1st Release Candidate for Swift for TensorFlow toolchain is available for download. Grab your copy from the [Releases](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#releases) section from the Install instructions. The release notes are available in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LihPvZRzbncMZtXnhhWzUNWzI_FOFee_RgcyjLjh6Cs/edit). Feel free to report any issues on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/swift) or create tickets on the respective tracking systems: [Swift Compiler](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF), [DeepLearning Library](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues).
