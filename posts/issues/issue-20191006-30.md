## News and Articles

* On Friday 4th of October, the 11th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Adam Paszke](https://twitter.com/apaszke) presented the tool he's been working on for static analysis of Tensor shapes. The tool will be published very soon so stay tunned. In the meantime check out the demo he did during the SIG meeting.

    You can find the meeting [recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_AnKkTJwcbz6g_hBqY0b0NqgrKxPhclI/view) notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).
