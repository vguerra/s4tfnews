## News and Articles

* The final release of Swift for Tensorflow v0.5 is now available. Feel free to try it out in Colab or download a pre-built pacakge from [Releases](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#releases) download area.

* [Siamak Ashrafi](https://twitter.com/biocodes) gave a talk at [360iDev](https://twitter.com/360iDev) conference this past August 2019. The title of his talk was *Why Swift for TensorFlow*, giving an overview of Machine Learning, as well as TensorFlow and why you should be using Swift for TensorFlow to train your models. You can finde the recording of his talk on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lovc4ZyWWn0).

* [Swift by Sundell](https://twitter.com/swiftbysundell) podcast, hosted by [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell), will be receiving as guests [Paige Bailey](https://twitter.com/dynamicwebpaige) and [Brennan Saeta](https://twitter.com/bsaeta) to talk about Machine Learning and Swift for Tensorflow. If you have a questions for them, be sure you reply to this [tweet](https://twitter.com/johnsundell/status/1178683513337499649?s=20).
