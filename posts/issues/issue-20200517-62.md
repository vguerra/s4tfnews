## News and Articles

* The final release for Swift for TensorFlow 0.9.0 is now available. Grab a copy from the [Release Candidate](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#release-candidates)'s section from the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md). The [S4TF v0.9 Release Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sk3F_owEF0wAo26xO1RTbdSbQV9eb5tMKQX3EgLeD1o/edit?usp=sharing) document guides you through all changes since v0.8. 


* On Friday 15th of May, the 32nd SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

	* [Brad Larson](https://twitter.com/bradlarson) presented a case study on using `X10` within the benchmarks found in [swift-models](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/tree/master/Benchmarks) repository. Some of the points covered were code changes you need to do to switch over to `X10`, as well as advices on debugging your implementations. He presented as well an [intro notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/site/tutorials/introducing_x10.ipynb) for `X10` You can find the case study [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C62yHsMYv3bkdSpj8SGQ-JKPaTtBapMJpFRJ4r1-IFg/edit?usp=sharing).

	Recording from this session is available [online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1icqNNoXDW1JR4yh7vBErgCRch9DWPfRM/view?usp=sharing).

	You can find the notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).


* A new Xcode 11 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2020-05-13-a-osx.pkg).
