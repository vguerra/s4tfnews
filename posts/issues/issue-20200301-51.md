## News and Articles

* On Friday 28th of February, the 24th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

	* [Ewa Matejska](https://twitter.com/ematejska) leaded the discussion around S4TF project organization tasks, like release process and bug filing, as well as ideas on improving project communication. Checkout the presentation [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XSKpOIt91CxhiMRndCoTh7bT8kpGibZ1/view?usp=sharing).
	* [Dan Zheng](https://twitter.com/dancherp) initiated the discussion around [PR-693](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/693) on [swift-apis](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis) regarding renaming of Recurrent Layers.
	
	You can find the [meeting recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hbDoLuuoCPKgqByqNm2ULfOGqc4WItYn/view?usp=sharing), notes  and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).
	
* The Agenda for this year's edition of [TensorFlow Dev Summit](https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit/agenda) has been released and there will be a session on Swift for TensorFlow: **Swift for Tensorflow Deep Dive**. Be sure to attend it if you happen to attend the event or follow the livestream on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0rqucBdTuFTjJiefW5t-IQ).

* A new Xcode 11 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2020-02-29-a-osx.pkg).
