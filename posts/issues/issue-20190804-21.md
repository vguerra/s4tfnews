## News and Articles

* On Friday 2nd of August, the 5th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Dan Zheng](https://twitter.com/dancherp) presented the internals of how the Automatic Differentiation is implemented in the Swift Compiler. If you missed [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1w2nyZmMWRtZeRuCp8H2se7kSWUyDOOu0Ua9koWNjK-E/edit?usp=sharing) I encourage you to have a read at the [Implementation Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_BirmTqdotglwNTOcYAW-ib6mx_jl-gH9Dbg4WmHZh0/edit#) document that Dan has put together.

    You can find the meeting notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).

## The mailing list

* [Cristian Garcia](https://github.com/cgarciae) shared on the mailing list [NDArray](https://github.com/cgarciae/NDArray), influenced by TensorFlow's `Tensor` API and numpy documentation. One of the key goals of the library is to make `NDArray` and its operations usable within Swift for Tensorflow. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/32MQAW39nnM/y_tlpGbMBwAJ)).
