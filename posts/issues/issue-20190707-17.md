## News and Articles

* [Brett Koonce](http://brettkoonce.com/) was at [AltConf 2019](http://altconf.com/) and gave an introductory talk about Swift for Tensorflow. Check out the [recording](http://altconf.com/)[](https://youtu.be/mo3fSb620og). üì∫

* [Erik Meijer](https://twitter.com/headinthebox) [shared the slides](https://twitter.com/headinthebox/status/1144650544633397250) from the Probabilistic and Differentiable Programming Summit where [Dan Zheng](https://twitter.com/dancherp) and [Richard Wei](https://twitter.com/rxwei) had the opportunity to talk about [Differential Programming in Swift](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EESLI-HaAUb6qbOBH_VN4AX3w4r66f1l/view). ü§ì

* [Brendan Hansknecht](https://github.com/bhansconnect) created a nice library in Swift which allows you to measure execution time of your code, inspired by IPython timeit functionality. It's called [SwiftTimeIt](https://github.com/bhansconnect/SwiftTimeit). ([original post](https://forums.fast.ai/t/timeit-built-in-swift/49401?u=vguerra)). ‚è∞

* [Ayush Agrawal](https://twitter.com/mantis0604) shares on [Medium](https://medium.com/gsoc-19/phase-1-completed-4d2d458c925b) his progress on his GSoC'19 project. Congratulations to him on successfuly completing the 1st Phase. üëèüèºüéä


* Under the umbrella of the MLIR project, two exciting announcements:
    * The Tensorflow components of MLIR were released in the wild.
    * The [MLIR project](https://github.com/tensorflow/mlir) is now ready to accept your contributions.

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25895): Adds support for differentiating `Array` literals initialization.

* [PR-25951](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25951): Renames `AdjointEmitter` class to `PullbackEmitter`.

* [PR-25684](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25684): Adds type-checking for top-level functions and methods annotated with `@transposing`.

* [PR-25924](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25924): Fixes compiler crash when differentiating a function that invokes a differentiable initializer.

* [PR-25914](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25914): Introduces support for `Differentiable` conformance derivation for `class` types.

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* Bug fixes for `_vjpConv2DBackpropInput`:
    * [PR-333](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/333): Fixes error on `Incompatible shapes`.

    * [PR-331](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/331): Fixes bug of incorrectly passing the shape argument to `conv2DBackpropFilter` as the filterSizes argument instead of passing the filter shape,

* Improvements to random seed generation:
    * [PR-328](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/328): Improves generation of default random seeds when in multi-process settings.
    * [PR-320](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/320).
        
* [PR-327](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/327): Pairs `Tensor.batchGathering(atIndices:)` implementation with it's Python counterpart, supporting variable number of batch dimensions and an axis to gather along.

* [PR-324](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/324): Teaches `Dense` `Layer` to use the batch variant of `matmul` when rank of `weight` is equal 3.

* [PR-326](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/326): Allows composable `Layer`s by introducing `Sequential` `Layer`.

* [PR-322](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/322): Makes all `Layer`'s tangent vector conform to `VectorProtocol & ElementaryFunctions & PointwiseMultiplicative`. Introduces as well `ParameterLessLayer` protocol.

* [PR-323](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/323): Renames `LazyTensor` to `LazyTensorHandle`.

* [PR-319](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/319): Standarizes initialization of `Layer`'s parameters introducing `typealias`'s: `ParameterInitialier` and `Activation`.

* [PR-321](http://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/321): Improves documentation for convolutional `Layer`s.

* [PR-312](http://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/312): Introduces orthogonal initializer for `Tensor`s.

## Contributing

Looking to contribute to the project? Have a look at the currently open tickets for starters:

#### Swift TensorFlow API

* [Issue-160](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues/160): Update doc comments on non-mutating API to use proper wording.
