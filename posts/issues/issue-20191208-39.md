## News and Articles

* [Paige Bailey](https://twitter.com/dynamicwebpaige) was at [Scale By The Bay 2019](https://www.scale.bythebay.io/) this past Novembere to talk about [Swift for TensorFlow](https://scalebythebay2019.sched.com/event/RoTl/swift-for-tensorflow-machine-learning-with-no-boundaries). You can watch now the recording of the talk on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/GDpqBBNElRo).

* This week [Rick Wierenga](https://twitter.com/rickwierenga) shared on his [blog](https://rickwierenga.com/) two great articles on Swift for TensorFlow:

    * [An introduction to GANS in Swift for TensorFlow](https://rickwierenga.com/blog/s4tf/s4tf-gan.html).
    * [Your first Swift for TensorFlow model](https://rickwierenga.com/blog/s4tf/s4tf-mnist.html).


* A new Xcode 11 Development snapshot is now available for you to try out Swift for Tensorflow. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2019-11-27-a-osx.pkg).

* On Friday 6th of December, the 17th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Magnus Hyttsten](https://twitter.com/magnushyttsten) walked us trhough the Swift code of `GridMaze` implementation within OpenSiel. You can have a look at the code in [GitHub](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/swift/Sources/OpenSpiel/GridMaze.swift).

    * [Anthony Platanios](https://twitter.com/eaplatanios) explained his [PR-231](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/231) that introduces support for BERT.

    You can find the meeting notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).
