## News and Articles

* The 2nd release candidate of Swift for Tensorflow v0.5 (RC1) is now available. Feel free to try it out in Colab or download a pre-built pacakge from [Release Candidates](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#release-candidates) download area.

* On Friday 20th of September, the 10th SIG Swift Design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * [Richard Wei](https://twitter.com/rxwei) [presented](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XTj_kaTGUKTPTSW1S5LT0kWe7xVfN6KWqu_7Q_x-JRU/edit?usp=sharing) the reasoning and work done for the introduction of `EuclideanDifferentiable` ( Ref: [TF-785](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-785))

    You can find the meeting [recording], (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iS3cKHxBOYp8TokE0gEUrZAGlwe0D6hd/view?usp=sharing) notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).


* [Eugene Burmako](https://twitter.com/eugene_burmako) and [Alex Suhan](https://github.com/asuhan) gave a talk at [SF Scala](https://www.meetup.com/SF-Scala/events/262262956/) meetup the past September 9th. The title of it was Swift as syntactic sugar for MLIR and you can find the recording on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VOWzfULX2w).

* Swift for TensorFlow has been featured in [InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com) in an article written by [Paul Krill](https://twitter.com/pjkrill) that briefly describes the general goals of the project.
