## News and Articles

* [Lex Fridman](https://twitter.com/lexfridman) invited [Chris Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm) to his [Artificial Intelligence Podcas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4) to talk about LLVM, how compilers work, Tensorflow, Swift for Tensorflow, MLIR among other topics. You can watch/listen the interview on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCd3CzGSte8).

* [James Thompson](https://twitter.com/wellfedwookiee) wrote a detailed post on Neural Style Transfer using Swift for Tensorflow. CHeck out his post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@build_it_for_fun/neural-style-transfer-with-swift-for-tensorflow-b8544105b854).

* [Zaid Alyafeai](https://twitter.com/zaidalyafeai) shared his implementation of Deep Dream using Swift for Tensorflow. Check out the notebook in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zaidalyafeai/Swift4TF/blob/master/Swift4TF_DeepDream.ipynb).

## The mailing list

* [Brett Koonce](https://twitter.com/asparagui) will give an introduction to Swift for Tensorflow at [AltConf](http://altconf.com/) this year.  ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/TjPoz0YCWXo/oVKcQeZLAAAJ)).

## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-24896](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24896): Adds ability to inter conformances protocol `Differentiable` from the parameters and result of a `@differentiable` function type.

* [PR-24861](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24861): Removes unused code within `_ExecutionContext`.

* [PR-24859](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24859): Makes `Tensor.broadcast(to:)` differentiable.

* [PR-24845](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24845): Revamps differentiation transform.

* [PR-24837](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24837): Cleans up `@_silgen_name` functions from TensorFlow's `CompilerRuntime.swift`.

* [PR-24825](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24825), [PR-24855](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24855): Removes `CotangentVector` and substitutes it's usages by `TangentVector`. As well merges `__Diferentiable` and `_Differentiable` protocols into `Differentiable`.

* [PR-24708](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24708): Defines `FileSystemProvider` within `SourceKit` so that it can support running in an environment where source files and dependencies are not in a local filesystem.

* [PR-24775](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24775): Makes JVP/VJP methods return a linear map that take/return tangent/cotagent last instead of first.

* [PR-24761](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24761): Introduces `AutoDiffIndexSubset` which holds parameter indices information to be used by the SIL's AutoDiff infrastructure.

* [PR-24736](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24736): makes `Array.DifferentiableView` to `CustomStringConvertible`.

* [PR-24722](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24722): Removes the following:
    * Calling convention `@convenction(tensorflow)`.
    * Attribute `@TensorFlowGraph`.
    . SIL `builtin`s: `tensorflowSend` and `tensorflowReceive`.

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* Bug fixes:
    * [PR-125](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/125): Fixes VJPs for `maxPooled3D` and `averagePooled3D`.
    * [PR-119](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/119): Fixes implementations of Layers: `AvgPool3d` and `Maxpool3d`.

* [PR-122](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/122): Substituting usages of `Cotangent` given that it has been deprecated ([PR-24825](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24825)).

## Starter bugs

Looking to contribute to the project? Have a look at the currently open tickets for starters: 

* [TF-416](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-416): Produce error upon second usage of `PythonLibrary.useVersion`.
