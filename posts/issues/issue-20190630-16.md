## News and Articles

* The first release candidate of Swift for Tensorflow v0.4 [is now available](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/Lp-eRTuW19w/RwAINKnSCgAJ). Feel free to try it out in Colab or download a pre-built pacakge from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#releases).

* Last Friday, 28th of June 2019, the 3rd S4TF open design meeting took place. Here you have the highlights:

    * Forthcoming release of Swift for Tensorflow v0.4 and fast.ai new course materials.

    * [Marc Rasi](http://www.marcrasi.com/) leaded the discussion on the design review for [Swift in Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pwCBVZXx0oiWnMNWGcjDgweChDiD93HjqSh6H_3sIao/edit#heading=h.xzptrog8pyxf).

    * [Dave Fenrnandes](https://github.com/dave-fernandes) wrote several flavors of an ECG Time-Series Classifier. One of them based on CNNs written in Swift for Tensorflow v0.4. Check out the [github repository](https://github.com/dave-fernandes/ECGClassifier).

    * The video of the 2nd S4TF open design meeting is now available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uwGV-XZmXzWFNgFXUEC9Eu-xbC_VADfk/view) üì∫.

    * Note that the meetings schedule for the 5th and 12th of July are cancelled. The next one will take place on July 19th 2019. ‚ö†Ô∏è

    You can find the meeting notes and all questions raised in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit#heading=h.ybjihr2k1s4).



* [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) has released their course: [Deep Learning from the Foundations](https://www.fast.ai/) which will guide you on how to build a deep learning model from scratch. The cool thing is that within the course Swift for Tensorflow is used in two lessons. The course is taught by  [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) but two lessons are co-taught by [Chris Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm). As well, an early version of the fast.ai library for Swift for Tensorflow has been published: [harebrain](https://github.com/fastai/harebrain). (Checkout as well the post on [tensorflow's medium account](https://medium.com/tensorflow/fast-ais-deep-learning-from-the-foundations-with-swift-for-tensorflow-3ee7dfb68387)).

* [Benedikt Herudek](https://twitter.com/Benudek) shared on [Medium](https://medium.com/@benedikt.herudek/switch2swift-for-deep-learning-ed40dc605fad) a write-up on the material of the recently released course from Fast.AI. He goes over the features of Swift for Tensorflow sharing along the way nice links for you to follow up on some topics. Check it out ü§ì.

* [Sanyam Bhutani](https://twitter.com/bhutanisanyam1) has started an online study group for Swift, Swift for Tensorflow and [fast.ai](http://fast.ai) course materials. If you would like to join him go to [http://dsnet.org](http://dsnet.org). You can find the recordings of the previous sessions as well in their [youbute channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmKaoNn0OvxVAe7f_8sXYNQ).

* We wanted to take the opportunity to thank all of our twitter-followers and subscribers of the mailint list. We reached 300 followers on twitter and 170 susbscribers in the mailing-list. Your likes, re-tweets and support are very much appreciated. üéäüôå.


## The mailing list

* [Anthony Platanios](https://twitter.com/eaplatanios) started a discussion around support for sparse gradients. ([original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/wxEyaPPL8hg/DwoZCEFxBgAJ)).
