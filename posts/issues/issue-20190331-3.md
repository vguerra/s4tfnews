## News and Articles

* A new development snapshot for Xcode 10 was released on March 26th. Get it [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/swift-tensorflow/mac/swift-tensorflow-DEVELOPMENT-2019-03-26-a-osx.pkg).

* [Richard Wei](https://twitter.com/rxwei) and [James Bradbury](https://twitter.com/jekbradbury) will be spkeaing at [Google I/O 2019](https://events.google.com/io/schedule/events/) about [Swift for TensorFlow](https://events.google.com/io/schedule/events/88dd5d2b-5e02-45b6-b603-dbb3bd673b66).

* [Paige Bailey](https://twitter.com/dynamicwebpaige?lang=en) was a guest on the on [TWiML & AI](https://twimlai.com) podcast. She talks about the latests TensorFlow updates including **Swift for Tensorflow**. Check out the [interview](https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-242-exploring-tensorflow-2-0-with-paige-bailey/).

## The mailing list

* [Anthony Platanios](https://twitter.com/eaplatanios) started a discussion on having fancy indexing for Tensors. The conversation turned into a concrete pull request:  [PR-23684](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/23684) that implements advanced indexing and slicing for Tensors. [[original message](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/swift/LPDeqmFU8n4/7h9xdTbMBAAJ)]

* If you are a student and would like to [contribute to the project](https://twitter.com/rxwei/status/1111398821722914816) during the [Google Summer of Code 2019](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline)  reach out to the team via the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/forum/swift).


## S4TF Commits

#### Swift Compiler (tensorflow branch)

* [PR-23647](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/23647): Moves into to the [swift-apis](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis) repository the following objects:
    * Ops: `batchNormalized`, `convolved2D`, `maxPooled`, `averagePooled`.
    * Gradients for : `batchNormalized`, `conv2d` for input and filter, `convolved2D`, `maxPooled`, `averagePooled`.

* [PR-22854](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/22854): Introduces derivation for protocols: `TensorGroup` and `TensorArrayProtocol`. As well, you now can use `Zip2TensorGroup` instead of `TensorPair` to represent a tuple of two types conforming to `TensorGroup`.

* [PR-23521](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/23521): Introduces `AnyDerivative`. A type-erased derivative value that forwards operations to it's underlaying derivative value which conforms to `Differentiable` and `AdditiveArithmetic`.

#### Swift TensorFlow APIs

* [PR-65](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/65): Introduces `GlobalAveragePooling2D` layer.

* [PR-64](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/64): Introduces `TransposedConv2D` layer.

* [PR-63](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/63): Moves in operations and gradients that were removed from the Swift compiler repository in [PR-23647](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/23647).

* [PR-61](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/pull/61): Introduces upsampling layer for 1-D inputs: `UpSampling1D`.

#### Swift Models

* [PR-75](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/75): Adds a `ResNet20` model.

* [PR-69](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/69): `MNIST` uses now a simple CNN.

* [PR-57](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/pull/57): Updates `ResNet` model to train as well on `CIFAR-10`.

## Starter bugs

Looking to contribute to the project? Have a look at the currently tickets for starters: 

* [TF-130](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-130): Add API to serialize a `@convention`(tensorflow) function as a graph.
* [TF-67](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-67):  BumpPtrAllocating some classes that have SmallBitVector fields.
