## News and Articles

During the 46th SIG Swift Design meeting, it was announced that the Swift for TensorFlow project, sadly, enters in [archive mode](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift#swift-for-tensorflow-in-archive-mode), meaning that this was the last publicly held meeting organized by Google.

Like you, I was not expecting this.

The only point announced in the agenda was: **latest S4TF's project updates**. [Brennan Saeta](https://twitter.com/bsaeta) started the presentation with a series of slides that were telling S4TF's history, he called it **S4TF History - The [Incomplete] Insider Edition** (I wonder, which part was/is he missing?), then he moved into a guessing game around numbers that somehow had a meaning within the context of the project, which was fun. Then, the unexpected, the **Moving Forward** slide, where he made the announcement that team members were transitioning to other projects and that S4TF was going into archieve mode. I invite you to have a look at the [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vxSIRq7KEmrFNAV_E0Wr7Pivn728Wcvs/view), and the recording (if eventually [it is released](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit).)

The lasts commits on the [tensorflow/swift](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift) summarize very well the most relevant contributions of the project since its conception, so I encourage you to have a look at the [README.md](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/main/README.md) for further details.

Given the archieving of S4TF on Google's side, I have decided to stop the newsletter for the time being and focus my efforts in other areas. Nevertheless, all content in [https://www.s4tfnews.com/](https://www.s4tfnews.com/) will still be available for the coming months.

I started this newsletter with the purpose of gathering, in one place, all the activity around S4TF. Mainly because I wanted to keep up with the changes affecting the Swift Compiler and the evolution of the Deep Learning library (what we know today as `Swift APIs`). Then I figured that maybe others could benefit from having such a summary, given them entry points to dig further on the latest changes in the ecosystem. So I decided to start the newsletter that you knew up until today.

The first issue, Issue #0, was sent on March 10th, 2019. Since then, a new issue was sent every monday, without interruption for 100 weeks.

I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you for supporting the newsletter by reding and sharing it. Specially, all [people](http://s4tfnews.surge.sh/people.html) that I had the opportunity to feature in here. It was defenitely a fun ride.

I leave you with a quote from Dr. Seuss: **Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.**.
