<h2>News and Articles</h2>
<p>During the 46th SIG Swift Design meeting, it was announced that the Swift for TensorFlow project, sadly, enters in <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/swift#swift-for-tensorflow-in-archive-mode">archive mode</a>, meaning that this was the last publicly held meeting organized by Google.</p>
<p>Like you, I was not expecting this.</p>
<p>The only point announced in the agenda was: <strong>latest S4TF's project updates</strong>. <a href="https://twitter.com/bsaeta">Brennan Saeta</a> started the presentation with a series of slides that were telling S4TF's history, he called it <strong>S4TF History - The [Incomplete] Insider Edition</strong> (I wonder, which part was/is he missing?), then he moved into a guessing game around numbers that somehow had a meaning within the context of the project, which was fun. Then, the unexpected, the <strong>Moving Forward</strong> slide, where he made the announcement that team members were transitioning to other projects and that S4TF was going into archieve mode. I invite you to have a look at the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vxSIRq7KEmrFNAV_E0Wr7Pivn728Wcvs/view">slides</a>, and the recording (if eventually <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fm56p5rV1t2Euh6WLtBFKGqI43ozC3EIjReyLk-LCLU/edit">it is released</a>.)</p>
<p>The lasts commits on the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/swift">tensorflow/swift</a> summarize very well the most relevant contributions of the project since its conception, so I encourage you to have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/main/README.md">README.md</a> for further details.</p>
<p>Given the archieving of S4TF on Google's side, I have decided to stop the newsletter for the time being and focus my efforts in other areas. Nevertheless, all content in <a href="https://www.s4tfnews.com/">https://www.s4tfnews.com/</a> will still be available for the coming months.</p>
<p>I started this newsletter with the purpose of gathering, in one place, all the activity around S4TF. Mainly because I wanted to keep up with the changes affecting the Swift Compiler and the evolution of the Deep Learning library (what we know today as <code>Swift APIs</code>). Then I figured that maybe others could benefit from having such a summary, given them entry points to dig further on the latest changes in the ecosystem. So I decided to start the newsletter that you knew up until today.</p>
<p>The first issue, Issue #0, was sent on March 10th, 2019. Since then, a new issue was sent every monday, without interruption for 100 weeks.</p>
<p>I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you for supporting the newsletter by reding and sharing it. Specially, all <a href="http://s4tfnews.surge.sh/people.html">people</a> that I had the opportunity to feature in here. It was defenitely a fun ride.</p>
<p>I leave you with a quote from Dr. Seuss: <strong>Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.</strong>.</p>
